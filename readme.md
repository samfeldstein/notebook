This repo is a work in progress! This is a to-do/record of things to mention in this doc.

- Hidden files
- Prefetch everything
- npm install
- <build> in _site output will be local host whenever 11ty makes changes without you running a build command explicity. But it doens't matter because when you push to Netlify it triggers a build, and that's when the url switches.
- Global data
- Local development url in <build>
- Prefetch
- Credit to Juan Frank - https://github.com/juanfrank77/foam-eleventy-template
- 404
- Offline - service worker - cache first? Or check in the bg somehow
- Recommended extensions
- Recommended settings
  - Nunjucks formatter
- Breadcrumbs
- Run content folder by itself or just use the 11ty root. Should work either way.
- Exclude foam from build
