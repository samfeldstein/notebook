A feeling that you matter? That you've made a difference? I suppose this depends on the person, so all I can do here is answer for myself. <strong>So for me, a sense of purpose is a sense that I've made a difference, that I've done something that matters.</strong></p><h2>Where do we find purpose?</h2><p>I used to think I could derive purpose from craft, from making things. Now I think this is wrong. There are plenty of things I like doing and find satisfying. Taking photos, for instance. I like taking photos, and I'm proud of many of the photos I've taken. But could I spend all day taking photos and be satisfied? No. Because while I <em>like</em> photography, I don't feel that it matters much. It doesn't give me a sense of purpose. The best photographers in the world probably feel differently.</p><p>So for me, the craft itself doesn't lend a send of purpose. <strong>The purpose comes from the application of the craft:</strong> I'm not coding just to code. I'm coding to build something I can use. I'm not writing just to write. I'm writing to figure something out.</p><p>So where <em>do</em> I get that feeling of purpose? When have I felt that? Here's a list:</p><ul><li>When I helped my mom research a court case.</li><li>When I've helped new dancers learn the basics.</li><li>When I organized a writers' group in grad school.</li><li>When I've given feedback on friends' writing.</li><li>When I taught horseback riding.</li></ul><p>These things all involve working with people. <strong>More specifically, they all seem to involve collaboration.</strong> Some of them involve some individual work (eg, researching a court case), but in service to a collaborative project. Teaching, when done right, is a kind of collaboration.</p><p>The goal of each collaboration seems to serve the other person. <strong>So it seems that I prefer helping to being helped.</strong></p><p>I'm not sure whether this would translate to collaborating in service to a mutual goal (eg, cofounding a company). I haven't done much of that. But I'm curious.</p><p>One of these (writers group) involves community-building. Haven't done much of that either. I do like hosting parties, though.</p><p><strong>The work matters too.</strong> I didn't enjoy helping my mom attach the snowplow to her truck nearly as much as helping her with the court case research. <strong>So the work needs to be engaging.</strong></p><p>So maybe the formula is something like: <em>Engaging work + helping + a useful application = a sense of purpose.</em> Or:</p><p><em><mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG" style="position:relative"><svg style="vertical-align:-.186ex" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15.682ex" height="1.805ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -716 6931.4 798" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mi"><use data-c="1D438" xlink:href="#MJX-TEX-I-1D438"></use></g><g data-mml-node="mo" transform="translate(986.2,0)"><use data-c="2B" xlink:href="#MJX-TEX-N-2B"></use></g><g data-mml-node="mi" transform="translate(1986.4,0)"><use data-c="1D43B" xlink:href="#MJX-TEX-I-1D43B"></use></g><g data-mml-node="mo" transform="translate(3096.7,0)"><use data-c="2B" xlink:href="#MJX-TEX-N-2B"></use></g><g data-mml-node="mi" transform="translate(4096.9,0)"><use data-c="1D434" xlink:href="#MJX-TEX-I-1D434"></use></g><g data-mml-node="mo" transform="translate(5124.7,0)"><use data-c="3D" xlink:href="#MJX-TEX-N-3D"></use></g><g data-mml-node="mi" transform="translate(6180.4,0)"><use data-c="1D443" xlink:href="#MJX-TEX-I-1D443"></use></g></g></g></svg><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>E</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>H</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>P</mi></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container></em></p><hr><p>Can we be sure we'll know it when we see it? I doubt it will be so epiphanic. It takes time to get comfortable with anything, and so even if you are currently occupying what will eventually become your place in the world, you may not be comfortable enough to realize it. And if you don't put in the time and effort, your place will never become your place.</p><p>I know there are people who describe it this way. They looked around, tried things, and found something they loved doing so much that it became obvious that that was their calling. But these people are the minority. How many people like that do you know personally?</p><p>So you have to look around, which takes time, but also if you're going to find your place, you're going to have to devote a certain amount of time to that place if anything is going to come of it. It's a dilemma.</p><p>I don't pretend to have the answers. And I suppose I'll only get the answers when and if I do find my place in the world. Until then, I'll have to get used to being uncomfortable. Which I'm okay at. I've always stuck to my comfort zone. I never wanted to do anything hard. I'm fundamentally scared and lazy, and this has held me back my whole life. I don't mean to pass the buck. It's my personality, my responsibiliy. But it's only lately that I've really tried to do anhthing about it. I guess I have done things about it my whole life, though it wouldn't look that way from the outside. Internally, probably what that looks like is me spending the first twenty-five years of my life working up the nerve to do anything interesting or discomfiting. Almost every decision I've made in the last year has been a direct assault on my lack of confidence. Traveling solo, for instance. I knew I could, but I needed to prove it. I doubt that will be the last time I do such a thing, because if I can't be doing something important I may as well be doing something interesting.</p><p>Dancing was another way I attacked my low self-esteem.</p><p>And I realize that all of this makes me fundamentally pathetic. I struggle to do things that in my imagination most people have been doing their whole lives. Asking women on dates, for instance. I think I've probably done this three times in my life. The reason I'm so far behind is that I struggle to be a person in ways that seem to come naturally to other people. I didn't know how to hold a conversation for years, and this is seomthing I still struggle with. I try to pay attention, to talk, but I can feel the conversation dying and I know it's my fault and I don't mean to but I can't help it. It's like I'm strangling it to death on accident. And I've always been like this. I've tried to study other people and how they talk to each other, though I don't think I've done so with much of a critical eye. MOre of an envious one, thinking <em>I wish I could do that. What's wrong with me that I can't?</em></p><p>But this kind of self-pity is dangerous. It's dnagerous because it's self-serving. It gives you an out. I've known this for a long time, and for a long time I haven't done anything about it even though I've wanted to. Hence the travel and the dance. If I can do those things, then I'm kind of person who does those things. And the kinds of people who do those things are cool, right?</p><p>It is entirely possible that my priorities are completely out of whack here. They usually are. But I have to admit that in a lot of ways I'm happy with the person I've become in the last two years. He's much more confident than he used to be. He's friendly. He's learned, somewhat, how to set the tone of an interaction. He's learned to become aware of other people and in so doing become less aware of himself. Or rather, to be aware of himself as part of the world instead of an island within it.</p><p>I've spent the last two years learning how to be a person. I don't what I was doing the rest of the time. Nothing particuarly interesting. Not building a career, that's for sure. I hate to think that it was time wasted, and not 100% of it was, of course. But a lot of it was. A lot of it was spent trying to force myseelf to write when I didn't want to.</p><p>But it's hard to know where to draw that line. At what point do you accept that something is hard, and do the work anything because it's worth it? And at what point do you realize that the reason the work is hard is that you don't actually like it very much?</p><p>I've found that some work is easier than others. I've drawn this comparison before, but building websites (to me) is much easiser than writing fiction. It's not that it's less work, insofar as it's quite time-consuming, but the difference lies in how easy it is to <em>do</em> the work. I don't have to force myself to build websites, at least when I'm doing it for myself. By contrast, I <em>always</em> had to force myself to write. Building websites is engaging in a way that writing fiction simply isn't. They're both work. But <em>doing</em> the work in one case is easy, and in the other the bulk of effort goes to just trying to keep myself at the desk.</p><p>That sounds pretty good, but I have my doubts. What if some work is just that much harder than other work. I've noted before that building websites almost feels like a video game at times, I think because it has a innate feedback loop that writing lacks. You write some code, and the result pops up in the browser. You instantly know if it's working, and there's great satisfaction to be taken when it is. Not so with writing. You can only really tell if it's working once you've had some time away from it, and even then it's not a sure thing.</p><p>But am I taking this feeling for granted? Maybe it's not the case for everyone. And if it's not, then shouldn't be take our kicks where we get them? If someone else described cooking the same way, I wouldn't be able to agree. Cooking is fun and satisyfing, but not nearly as engaging as coding. But if someone found cooking as engaging as I find coding, I'd say that person is cut out to be a chef.</p><p>But still, it's not that simple. Because I only find coding that engaging when I care about the project. I had fun builidng my personal site. Likewise with my mom's website. But my freelance gigs aren't nearly as fun, and I think this is because I just don't care as much. The emotional investment isn't there. Which tells that the emotional investment is necessary to doing good work. That might seem obvious, but I've also spent a lot of time trying to detach myself emotionally from a given project becasue I was convinced that toom uch investment was a bad thing, because it tied too much of your self worth to the project and so engendered self-consciousness. If I could just become a stoic craftsman, then maybe I could do something interseting, free from fear and doubt.</p><p>There might be something to that, and I doubt there's one way to go about it. Probably you just have to find the thing that works for you. If you can't get there without the emotional volatility, embrace it. If you can only get there by quashing the feelings, crush them mercilessly. Usually you can do this with another feeling. Quash doubt with anger, for instance. That takes an immense amount of effort, which is probably why writing is so exhausting. You're trying to keep a lid on the self-doubt while perfecting a craft at the same time.</p><p>This is why people like Ray Bradbury tell you not to think. Stephen King says to write fast enough to outrun the self doubt. Another way to think about it is to do your best to try to get absorbed in the work to such a degree that you and your feelinsg disappers, and all that's left is the work.</p><p>Which comes back to engagement. The more engaging work is, the easier it is to fall into it, so to speak. But choosing activities solely based on how engaging they are seemsl ike a bad idea. If you did that, you'd just play video games all day. That said, I don't find video games nearly as engaging as I used to. So this, like all things, seems subject to change.</p><p>The broader question though is is it wrong to choose work based on how engaging it is? Am I wrong to choose websites over writing because I find building websites so much more engaging than writing? I don't see why that should be a problem. If you can find something useful to do that you don't have to force yousrelf to do, that seems like as close a recipe to career happiness as you can get.</p><p>But it's multivariate. The work either has to be engaging enough or important enough to make up for it. Writing simply isn't important enough to me to make up how not engaging it is. Coding is engaging, but when I do for anyone other than myself or someone I care about, suddnely it's not important enough to be worth the effort.</p><p>That's why I want to work for myself. Maybe I'm selfish, but I find it very difficult to summon the will to work for other people. I <em>can</em> do it. I <em>have</em> done it. And I've worked hard. But it's no way to spend a life. The solution is to work for myself, or possibly with a friend. I'm pretty sure that's as close to a satisfying career as I'm ever going to get.</p><p>You could make some money with some of these things. You could open a coffee shop or a dance studio. You could open an online boutique selling personal little sites. The first two are out of the question; I don't have the money or the expertise, and anyway the margins on coffee probably aren't worth the startup cost. I do plan to open that online boutique someday soon, if I can figure out how to minimize the workload such that I can charge a reasonable rate.</p><p>It's career as distinct from life. This is a common dichotomy. Everybody understands it. You work a job you don't like to make money so you can afford to do the things you do like. Ideally, you find work you like doing enough that you don't feel the need to draw that dichotomy. The only way I see that happening for me is if I start my own business. Because if I'm working for a boss, or even for freelance clients, that dichotomy is always going to be there because work is always going to be something to escape. The line is drawn by relief.</p><p>But if you work for yourself, running a business for instance, than it becomse another activity you enjoy. Just one where you're making money. The hard line between work and life starts to fade, and then it's just life.</p><p>There are two ways to make money.
