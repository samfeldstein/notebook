I won't say slowly, because sometimes the most thoughtful course of action means quickening the pace. So it's a matter of awareness. <strong>The rule is to be aware of what the rule is at any given moment.</strong></p><h2>How to decide what to work on?</h2><blockquote><p><em>Look at your options now and choose the one that gives the most interesting options for the future.</em></p><p>Paul Graham via David Epstein, <em>Range</em></p></blockquote><h3>How to know when to switch focus?</h3><p>You know it's time to quit when you aren't learning.</p><p>But quitting isn't a great word, because it sounds permanent. Whatever you're &quot;quitting&quot; might come in handy later. So instead, let's call it a change. How do you know when it's time for a change? When you aren't learning anything, especially about yourself and/or how the world works.</p><h2>Late bloomers</h2><blockquote><p>Finally, there are the people Galenson calls “the masters.” In his book <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780691133805"><em>Old Masters and Young Geniuses</em></a>, he writes about people like Cézanne or Alfred Hitchcock or Charles Darwin, who were not all that successful—and in some cases just not even very good at what they did—when they were young.</p><p>These people don’t do as much advanced planning as the conceptual geniuses, but they regard their entire lives as experiments. They try something and learn, and then they try something else and learn more. Their focus is not on their finished work, which they often toss away haphazardly. Their focus is on the process of learning itself: <em>Am I closer to understanding, to mastering?</em> They live their lives as a long period of trial and error, trying this and trying that, a slow process of accumulation and elaboration, so the quality of their work peaks late in life. They are the ugly ducklings of human achievement, who, over the decades, turn themselves into swans.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/06/successs-late-bloomers-motivation/678798/">David Brooks</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Late bloomers tend to have a high tolerance for ambiguity, and can bring multiple ways of thinking to bear on a single complex problem. They also have a high tolerance for inefficiency. They walk through life like a curious person browsing through a bookstore. In old age, the historian Daniel Boorstin wrote, “The amateur spirit has guided my thinking and writing.” He had wandered from subject to subject throughout his life, playing around.</p><p>Ibid.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The benefits of this kind of curiosity might be hard to see in the short term, but they become obvious once the late bloomer begins to take advantage of their breadth of knowledge by putting discordant ideas together in new ways.</p><p>Ibid.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Successful late bloomers combine this high need for cognition with a seemingly contradictory trait: epistemic humility. They are aggressive about wanting to acquire knowledge and learn—but they are also modest, possessing an accurate sense of how much they don’t know.</p><p>This mentality combines high self-belief (I can figure this out on my own; I know my standards are right and the world’s standards are wrong) with high self-doubt (There’s a lot I don’t know, and I am falling short in many ways).</p><p>Ibid.</p></blockquote><h2>Efficiency</h2><blockquote><p>Too often, in web development, I feel like I’m wrestling with incidental complexity that has nothing to do with the actual problem at hand. I’m wrangling npm dependencies, or debugging my state manager, or trying to figure out why my test runner isn’t playing nicely with my linter. Some people really enjoy this kind of stuff, and I find myself getting sucked into it sometimes too. But I think ultimately it’s a kind of fake-work that feels good but doesn’t accomplish much, because your end-user doesn’t care if your bundler is up-to-date with your TypeScript transpiler.</p><p><a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2023/08/23/use-web-components-for-what-theyre-good-at/">Nolan Lawson</a></p></blockquote><h2>Some work is easier</h2><p>Some types is easier. For example, when I'm coding, it's not that the work is easy, but it's easy to do the work. Putting in the hours isn't the hard part.</p><p>I cant say the same for writing fiction. Writing nonfiction falls somewhere in between.</p><h2>Innovation</h2><p>Yokoi (inventor of the Gameboy) liked to use tech that was cheap or even obselete. So before you go and reinvent the wheel, first see if you can <a href="/notes/problem-solving/" title="Problem Solving">solve your problem</a> with the materials you already have.</p></div></main><footer>Powered by <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode">Foam</a> and <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>.</footer></body></html>
