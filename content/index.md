Hi, I'm **Sam Feldstein**. I'm a frontend developer from Iowa, and this is not a blog. It's more like a [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com), or a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history?ref=ideasurg.pub). I call it a notebook, because a notebook is something you write in and that's what I'm doing here. It is not dissimilar to a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) or a [waste book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_book). It is the place I go to figure things out. In that spirit, expect notes to be unpolished and incomplete. Thoughts herein should not be mistaken for firm beliefs.

I've made this notebook public for two reasons: The first is that I like the idea of [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ). Second, I've learned so much from [people writing on the internet](https://samfeldstein.xyz/blogroll/) that I feel obligated to pay it forward.
