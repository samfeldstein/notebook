Welcome to my digital notebook, also known as a [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com) or a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history?ref=ideasurg.pub). I call it a notebook, because a notebook is something you write in and that's what I'm doing here. It's not dissimilar to a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) or a [waste book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_book). It's the place I go to figure things out. In that spirit, a lot of notes are unpolished and incomplete.

I've made this notebook public for two reasons: The first is that I like the idea of [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ). Second, I've learned so much from [people writing on the internet](https://samfeldstein.xyz/blogroll/) that I feel obligated to pay it forward.

So have a look around. You can start by purusing the [tags page](/tags/), typing random words into the [search  bar](/search/), or reading more about this website in my [notes on the subject](notes/digital-notebook-project-notes.md). If you happen to find anything useful or interesting, <a href="mailto:samuelfeldstein@proton.me">send me an email</a>. I'd love to hear about it.
