Hi, I'm **Sam Feldstein**. I'm a frontend developer from Iowa, and this is not a blog. It's more like a second brain, or a digital garden. I call it a notebook, because a notebook is something you write in and that's what I'm doing here. It is not disimlar to a wastebook or a commonplace book. It is the place I go to figure things out.

In that spirit, expect notes to be unpolished and incomplete. Thoughts herein should not be mistasken for firm beliefs. If you're looking for polished essays, I have a few of those on my [blog](https://samfeldstein.xyz/blog/).

I've made it public because I believe in the free exchange of ideas, and in any case I've learned so much from reading blogs and websites. We all start somewhere. We all owe our knowledge to someone  Making our knowledge public is a way to pay it forward.

## Why make it public?

*Range.* Innocentive. The more access the better. I've gotten way too much value from people like Gwern putting their thoughts on the internet to not want to do it myself.

and this is my digital notebook. The idea is to work with the garage door up, as it were (as that one guys puts it)

## Infrastructure

On the local level, this site is a collection of markdown files. I write the files with VS Code. The files are processed by [Foam](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode), which draws all the connections between tags and backlinks and renders them in a side panel.

The idea is to draw connections between ideas, even (especially?), dispartes one.

The site is generated by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and deployed with [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) as a subdomain of my [main site](https://samfeldstein.xyz).
