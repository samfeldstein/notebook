Is it possible that we only need to defend monogamy so vigorously because itâ€™s unnatural?

## Assumptions to examine

- Monogomy is vigorously defended
- Monogomy is unnatural
- That something is unnatural makes it bad

## Counterexamples

What else seems natural that we also defend? Human rights?

## Origins of monogamy

Presumably, we invented beds because the ground was uncomfortable. Is it possible that we invented monogamy because social-sexual dynamics were also uncomfortable?

## Did we pair-bond in prehistory?

I do wonder if pairing off was even relevant in prehistoric times. Our closest ape relatives don't practice pair-bonding, as far as I know. So I wonder if sex was more like eating, if we can be crass for a moment. You have your favorite foods, but just because you love hamburgers doesn't mean you're going to eat hamburgers and only hamburgers for the rest of your life.
