## "Jews are white"

It's obviously possible to repeat and espouse antisemitic ideas when you aren't antisemitic. So it's inevitable that some people will be accused of hating Jews when they don't. That's got to hurt. Nobody likes to be called a racist. Though I have to admit, it is a little bit funny when college-educated white kids who've spent the last ten years telling everyone that they're racist find out that they might kind of hate Jews a little bit.

But they have an easy answer to that, of course. They just say that Jews are white, and you can't be racist against white people.
