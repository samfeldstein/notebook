title: Nesting Tags
tags: ["knowledge-management"]

It seems to undercut that flexibility that makes tags so useful. If you want to find all your vegan cookie recipes, it makes just as much sense, if not more, to search for notes tagged `cookies` and `vegan` as it does to search for `cookies/vegan`. 

So I'm not convinced that nesting is actually an advantage.
