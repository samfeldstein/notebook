To the Tara Faculty and Staff:

I'm writing to apply for the Executive Assistant position with Tara High School, as posted on Indeed. I believe my organizational and administrative skills and my interest in education align well with this role.

I realize my resume is a little unorthodox. The ultra-short story there is: I used to want to be a screenwriter, I went to school for it, didn't like it, withdrew, moved to West Texas, managed a coffee shop, wrote for the local paper, moved out of West Texas, traveled around while freelancing as a web developer, wound up in Boulder, had an epiphany, rented a place here, walked to Rayback, ordered a coffee, sat down, found your job posting, wrote this email.

I've had so many jobs over the years because until recently I never really knew what I wanted to do. It was a long time before I finally figured out that the only way to know what you're interested in is to explore. That's why I find the Waldorf approach interesting: It emphasizes the kids' interests as determined by the kids themselves.

Recently, my explorations brought me to psychology, particularly as it pertains to development and learning. As of this month, I'm enrolled in a psychology course at Yale through Coursera. If all goes well, I intend to go back to school for Psychology next year.

In the meantime, I'm looking for work related to either education or research, and my skills are best suited to an operations- or administrative-type role. I'm tech-savvy and organized, detail-oriented, a skilled writer and a good speaker. I learned to write from school, and from my time in West Texas as a freelance journalist. At the Sentinel (the coffee shop owned by the paper I wrote for), I was the de facto manager, though I prefer "Studio Fixer But for a Coffee Shop." Basically, whatever anyone else didn't want to do or know how to do, they gave to me.

I believe I have the requisite skills and interests to excel as an Executive Assistant for Tara High School. I'm excited to put those skills to use for an institution dedicated to a truly thoughtful approach to education.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward very much to discussing the position further.

Sincerely,

Sam Feldstein
