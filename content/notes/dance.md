## What is dance?

**Dance is a dynamic.** When you dance with someone, you become a system. Riding horses is the same way. When practiced correctly, aliens should come down and not immediately understand that they are looking at two organisms, such is the level of harmony.

**Dance is singing with the body.**

## Fundamentals

A shortcut to figuring out the fundamental dance ingredients is to see what all the different dances have in common.

## Dance as hedonic design

> *The Maverick is a marvel of hedonic design. The ride begins with a literal peak, a 105-foot hill with a 95-degree drop. The track is packed with variators, banks and turns and flips and something called a [“twisted horseshoe roll.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster_element#Twisted_horseshoe_roll) Then there’s a disruptor: the train comes almost to a standstill inside a tunnel, convincing first-timers that either the ride is over or something’s gone wrong. Then another peak: you suddenly accelerate to 70mph in three seconds, blasting out of the tunnel and into the sky. The finale is a rapid-fire series of banks, spins, and a flight over a canyon where you dodge cannons firing water plumes. The cutoff comes after a mere 150 seconds, just before your brain is totally liquified inside your skull. Recyclers are available as you stagger off the ride: they’ve taken a photo of you screaming your head off, and you can take it home for a mere $20.*

As a leader, you design the roller coaster.
