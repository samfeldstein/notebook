Dance is a superfood for social skills.

---

Practice deliberately, perform intuitively.

Improvement requires [attention](how-to-pay-attention.md). Attention comprises two parts: aim and observation. You aim for an outcome, and you observe what works and what doesn't.

In dance, you aim for crescendos. **The hitting of crescendos is what makes dance an experience** (where an *experience* is something that makes you feel alive).

Don't look too far ahead or you'll go too long without doing anything interesting. Any case, if you do enough little interesting things, the dance will add up to one big interesting thing. *If the process is sound, the product takes care of itself* (William Zinsser, *On Writing Well*).
