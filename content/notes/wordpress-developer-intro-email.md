Hi, my name is Sam Feldstein. I'm a Web Developer with about a year's experience building sites for small businesses and individuals, and I'm looking for my first full-time role.

I was excited to come across your job posting on Indeed, because Bright Minds is exactly the kind of high-impact organization I'd like to work for. I think the work you're doing to battle homelessness is incredibly valuable, and I'd love to be a part of it.

I have a thorough knowledge of HTML, CSS, accessibility, and site performance. I have a working knowledge of JavaScript, WordPress, and I also have some experience with Wix.

You can see the sites I've built on my portfolio:Â [https://samfeldstein.xyz/websites/](https://samfeldstein.xyz/websites/). I've also attached my resume below for you convenience.

Thank you for your time, and I hope we can speak soon! In any case, keep up the good work.

All the best,

Sam
