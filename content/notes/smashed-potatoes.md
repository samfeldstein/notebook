Original recipe from [Natasha's Kitchen](https://natashaskitchen.com/smashed-potatoes-recipe-video/).

## Ingredients

- Baby potatoes
- Olive oil
- Garlic salt
- Black pepper
- Shredded parmesan
- Parsley

## Directions

1. **Boil potatoes** in a pot of water with 2 tsp salt. Simmer 20-30 minutes (depending on the thickness of potatoes), until tender.
2. **Drain potatoes and** transfer to a [silpat](https://amzn.to/2GkFzN4) lined [baking sheet](https://amzn.to/36esos5) and cool for 10-15 minutes. Using a potato masher or the bottom of a drinking glass, gently press down on each potato, pressing to about 1/2″ thickness and being careful not to break potatoes apart.
3. **Season and Bake:** Drizzle half of the olive oil over one side of potatoes and sprinkle with half of the seasonings. Bake, uncovered, at 450 for 12 to 15 min or until bottoms are lightly golden.
4. **Turn potatoes** with a spatula, drizzle with remaining oil and sprinkle with remaining seasonings. Bake 12 to 15 min or until potatoes are golden brown and crisp.
5. **Sprinkle parmesan** on potatoes and broil 2 to 3 min to melt the cheese.
