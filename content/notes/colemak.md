I had pain in my hands, so I switched keyboard layouts.

Switched yesterday (March 5th, 2025). Started today without using the accessibility keyboard. Still lots of guessing, but in general I already have a sense of where most of the keys are.

I'm tracking my progress with [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/).

As of May 28, 2025, my average typing speed over the last ten tests is 64 word per minute. My pain is *much* better.
