<aside  class="callout"><p>This is my personal career guide. It is not meant to be generalized or taken as any kind of professional advice. Like everything else in this notebook, Iâ€™m making it public in case anybody finds it useful.</p></aside>

Get a [degree](notes/cybersecurity-degree-programs.md). The one I'm looking at comes with an IT certification. If possible, use that to get a help desk job while you go to school.

In the meantime, meet people in the industry. I've already joined some [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/home/). You could also volunteer with an organization like [ISSA](https://www.denverissa.org/about).
