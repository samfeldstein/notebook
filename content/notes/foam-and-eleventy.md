## Relative links

Relative links, as generated by Foam, don't work with 11ty's `_site/` output.

Relative links in the source folder (eg `../recipes/cake.md`) don't account for the build output's pretty link structure, which looks like this: `_site/recipes/cake/index.html`. The relative link can't account for that extra `cake/` folder.

I don't think this is a [[private-notes-in-eleventy]]oblem with Foam. I think it's a problem with [SSGs and pretty urls](relative-links-and-static-site-generators.md). Luckily, [Juan Frank](https://github.com/juanfrank77) figured out how to deal with it in his [Eleventy Foam Template](https://github.com/juanfrank77/foam-eleventy-template). The solution involves regex and [Markdown-It](https://markdown-it.github.io).

## Wikilinks

Eleventy (or any static site generator, probably) doesn't know what to do with wikilinks, so you have to tell it. Again, Juan Frank's solution was helpful here, but he didn't account for pipe notation (as far as I could tell). So a link like this `[note-file-name|Note File Name]` would render like that in the output.

With [Claude's help](https://claude.ai/new), I added a regex that deletes the text to the left of the pipe.
