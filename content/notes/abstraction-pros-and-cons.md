## Pros

### Democratization

Abstractions make it possible for a lot more people to do a lot more things with a given tool. I'm thinking of computers. Computers have a file manager application so people don't have to mess with the terminal. And the terminal is itself an abstraction, a GUI that sits on top of something I don't understand.

The goal of abstraction, basically, is to make things easy, and that's generally a good thing. Think of cars. You used to have to hand-crank the engine. Now you have to turn a key. And now, in a lot of cars, you don't even have to do that. You just have to push a button.

The easier things are to use, the more people can use them.

### Resource Conservation

When things are easy, we don't have to worry about them, and we're free to do other things.

## Cons

The more user-friendly you make a tool, the more people use the tool. But the more user-friendly you make a tool, the harder it is (and the less relevant it becomes) to tell how the tool works. **Use increases while understanding decreases**.

One if we forced everyone to use the terminal that would presumably result in a lot more tech-savvy people, but then there's also the argument where well we wouldn't have invented beds if the ground was comfortable.

Maybe it comes down to whether you're in favor of lowering the barrier of entry to programming. Is the reaction from programmers to programming with AI different from the reaction of clergy to translating the Bible to English?

What do we lose when we make things too easy? Think of people who lament the decline of the stickshift. **There's something missing from a frictionless life**. ("Yeah! *Friction*, stupid!)

### Waste

When things are easy to use, we use them more, and may consume more resources in the process. I wonder if households used a lot less water before washing machines were invented.

This is especially bad if the additional consumed resources include our own time. I read somewhere that when the washing machine was invented, housewives actually spent *more* time doing laundry, because they *could* do so much more.

So what's the lesson there? Be suspicious of products that are supposed to make your life easier. Or at least pay attention to whether they actually do.
