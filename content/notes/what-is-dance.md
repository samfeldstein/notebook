Two fish swim past each other. One says, *Mornin' there! How's the water?* The other says, *What's water?*[^1]

It's hard to see an object from inside the object. In dance, it's easy to get lost in the weeds of footwork, frame, and connection. These things matter, but they amount to nothing if you lose sight of the big picture. **You can't play with a form if you don't know it exists.** So we need to find the form.

To find the form, we have to ask what the thing actually is. Try to cut to the core of the thing and identify the fundamental structure or process underlying it. The goal is to understand the thing intuitively. To get a feel for it. [*Oppenheimer*](https://youtu.be/qiuSBWVdgLI?si=02sJJod6FA9kdgK6) said it best: ***The important thing isn't can you read music, it's can you hear it?***

In this case, the analogy is so apt it's not even an analogy. "Hearing the music" in dance really means *hearing the music.* There's a reason we don't dance to silence. **Dancing is singing with the body**. Without the music, there is no song to sing.

## Dance is Singing with the Body

You don't sing *to* music. You sing a song. Likewise with dance. **You don't dance *to* music. You dance music.** You embody it. You become it. Aliens should come down and not immediately understand that the music isn't coming *from* you.

Take the music inside you, and let it lead the way.

## Dance as hedonic design

> The Maverick is a marvel of hedonic design. The ride begins with a literal peak, a 105-foot hill with a 95-degree drop. The track is packed with variators, banks and turns and flips and something called a “twisted horseshoe roll.”
> 
> Then there’s a disruptor: the train comes almost to a standstill inside a tunnel, convincing first-timers that either the ride is over or something’s gone wrong. Then another peak: you suddenly accelerate to 70mph in three seconds, blasting out of the tunnel and into the sky.
> 
> The finale is a rapid-fire series of banks, spins, and a flight over a canyon where you dodge cannons firing water plumes. The cutoff comes after a mere 150 seconds, just before your brain is totally liquified inside your skull. Recyclers are available as you stagger off the ride: they’ve taken a photo of you screaming your head off, and you can take it home for a mere $20.

**Dance is a roller coaster.**

## Dance is Symmetry

When you dance with someone, **you become a system**. The aliens should not immediately understand that they are looking at two distinct organisms.

Systems rely on symmetry.

When two forces act on each other in equal proportion, you get symmetry. Think of a star and a planet. The planet orbits the star. If the star's gravity were too strong, it'd suck the planet into its core. If the planet were moving too fast, it'd fly off into space. Neither happens, because the relationship between the star's gravity and the planet's speed is symmetrical. It is balanced.

Likewise with dance. The leader is the star, because they remain more or less centered, while the follower "orbits" them. The follower is the planet, because they do all the spinning.

So I think what you have to do is attune yourself to your center of gravity, then attune your center of gravity to your partner's center of gravity. (I assume it's ideal when both partners are trying to do this.) If you can do that, you get symmetry.

How do you attune yourself to your center of gravity? Well, first you have to find it. I'm guessing's everybody's center will be in a slightly different place. Mine hovers just below my solarplexis.

Once you find your center, you dance from it. It's tempting to dance from your feet, because that's how we walk; you move your foot first, then your body follows through. In dance, it's the other way around. Instead of moving your feet first, you move your center first, and simply let your feet come with you. For me, this is challenging. I'm still not very good at it, even after almost six months. But I think it's the right idea.

But when you dance, structure is important, and structure comes from your spine. So to keep your spine straight, you have to engage your core.

I think that's what frame is all about. *Frame* is your body structure.



## Going Forward

If I want to get better at dancing, I'll probably have to deepen my understanding and appreciation for music.
