title: Markdown Frontmatter
tags: ["knowledge-management","markdown","web-development"]

Titles and tags should go in the frontmatter, reason being flexibility. If I my tags and titles were in the body, and I wanted to style them as one block (wrapped in a `<header>`, say), I'd have to manually insert a component in every file.

So putting tags and titles (and dates, and whatever) in the frontmatter is the more convenient and flexible choice. From there, I can feed them through a component and render them however and wherever I want.
