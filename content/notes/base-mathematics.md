A base (also called a radix) is the number of unique digits, including zero, that a [positional numeral system ](notes/positional-notation.md) uses to represent numbers.

For example, the decimal system has a base of 10 because it uses the digits 0 through 9. The binary system has a base of 2 because it uses only the digits 0 and 1.
