- Make sure the site is [performant](notes/web-performance-checklist.md).
- Add [structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data).
	- [Validate](https://validator.schema.org).
- Add [Open Graph Markup](notes/open-graph-markup.md).

- [Request indexing](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/ask-google-to-recrawl).
