## Characters

A glutton demon who is belemic.

Evil Mary Poppins.

Postal worker who's been mauled by a dog. Based on article in readwise.

A snakeoil saleswoman...only she's not selling snakeoil, but real potions. She's an alchemist. Or a witch.

## Premises

A group of outlaws or something, when they die, manage to evade the devils agents somehow and then its a chase movie as they try to make it to heaven.

Politcal candidaste are hidden before they're elected. You don't seen their faces, you don't hear their voices. All you know about them is their voting record and policy positions.

Comedy. Girlfriend has a huge family. As in they're giants.

How Hjorvarth retakes his kingdom. His father's kingdom falls and he finds himself a wanted man.

The troll story, and the hero is hjorvarth. But it's from the trolls' perspective.

How Hjorvarth became a wolfeater. Becoming more of an animal, shedding the inhibitions of civilization in order to do what he must. Become the monster to fight monsters.

He was a warrior before he was exiled, but didn't become a wolfeater till after, because that was the first time he was assigned to the wilderness.

He found a hermit berserker who trained him. Maybe this man was a hermit, maybe an enemy who became a friend. Or at least a mentor.

True Grit parody where they shoot the horse but its a truck.

Babysitter. There's someone trapped in the basement.

Cadaver dealer. Heard about on Econmics of everday things.

Bishop Rivers. Work on character. Remember his partner Jay Hart who had a radio show called the Hauntline.

Bishops van gets stolen. Part of a larger collection about Bishop, probably.

Character: boone may, a legendary shotgun messenger. Read about him in *Bad Boys of the Black Hills.*

A story about someone whose wife possessed by a demon (maybe a monster hunter tale) and he keeps her sedated with drugs (opium? chloroform?) and by the the monster hunter gets to them and gets the demon out she has so much brain damage that she might as well be dead. Or else, she has some brain damage but she's also addicted to opium or whatever. So basically it's just totally sad.

Character: Monster-hunting Gun-slinging Priest.

- His father was a fake preacher (maybe was a real one once?) who used his perceived status to peddle elixers. So a snakeoil salesman who peddles false spritual remedies as well as those for physical ailments.
- Their family was always moving around because his father kept getting run out of town.
- His wife got hooked on his "elixer." Which was really some sort of addctive drug.
- His wife, at some point, was turned into a vampire.
- Father kept her sedated with elixer.
- Father drugged wife and buried her alive.
- Father lied to hunter about it.
- At some point hunter found out the truth.
- He tracks down father and finds him a drunk. Playing the same act maybe, but worse than ever.
- He makes father go with him and show him where the grave is.
- He makes father dig up the grave. Meanwhile, hunter gets ready.
- Mother bites father.
- Hunter kills mother.
- Hunter buries father alive.
- Hunter buries mother.
- Monster hunter went to study in Rome.
- He carries a black pistol with a cross on the butt, a la Ben Wade. Also, it's cursed.
- When he dies, he goes to Hell. Come to find that not only has God not forgiven him, God hasn't even been watching since he committed his first act of evil.
- His outerly appearance may vary, but his dress is generally the same, and is akin to that of Brad Pitt in *The Assassination of Jesse James*. The difference is that Rance wears a clerical collar.
- Before Rance was Rance, %% He becomes the Rancid Mayhem after he dies? Combine the two characters? %% was [name?], a mystic and gunfighter who set himself the task of rooting out the work of the Devil. He considered himself an agent of God. He wore a collar and called himself a priest, though he belonged to no church. He preferred his own experience to conventional wisdom or doctrine.
- In his effort to battle evil, he succummbed to it. Thus, his life an ongoing irony. He's doing the same work, only now he's doing it for Hell.
- Maybe he was killed by the band of demon outlaws. Then he was sent back? But then he wasn't a demon, he was just a damned soul. Maybe he was down there for some time. Ten years or something. Or twenty. They killed him in the early-mid 19th century, and he returned in the late 19th century. By then he would have been pretty warped, even if he wasn't the Rancid Mayhem yet.
- I'd imagine ending up in Hell was a surprise to him. I'd imagine there was some hubris at work. He was pretty righteous. But God abandoned him. He'd strayed from the path without even realizing it.
- Mother was a woman of God. In a hard, fire and brimstone sort of a way. And she believed in his father more than his father believed in himself.

Rance's origin story: In the old west, Rance has to hunt down a demon who has become the leader of a band of outlaws. Maybe they're all rogue demons.

A demon pretends to be a child and shows himself to a woman who lost her child. So she takes him in. So it's a possession of another kind. Could be a Rance story.

A larger story arc about Rance where some organization is trying to track him down. It could be some kind of clandestine wing of the church. Like the Pinkerton's, but for the church. And so they interview people who've encountered Rance. Nora, for instance.

Character: Hell's Fixer. Satan's right hand. Think Eddie Mannix and Arthur Pym. Maybe his name's Eddie Arthur. Or Arthur Mannix. Or Art Mannix. Or just take the name of a real person, like Eddie Mannix. "You say, 'We've got a problem.' He says, 'I'll take care of it.' Maybe he was a studio fixer in life. But if that's the case, he hasn't actually been doing this very long. In the scheme of things.

Superior Jeans. A commercial.

The spit take sketch, but where they hear the crazy thing, *then* drink something and do the spit take. And maybe there's a situation where they have to look around for something to drink so they can react. The implication being that it's the only way they know how to react.

high moon. a western comedy. on the moon. is this already a thing? Everybody moves real slow cause gravity. Probably a movie.
- Ar-15 up the sleeve
- Teamsters with CBs
- A dog that shoots a gun - based on that Conan sketch

The story about Mede (?) The king who fed a mans son to him because the man was supposed to kill the kid fourteen years ago and didnt. heard on hardcore history king of kings 2:00. The climax is when he tells the guy he's eating his kid.

Magic item: A staff cut from the tree of death. Or life? Used as a weapon maybe.

A huge army that gets buried in a sandstorm en route. Supposedly this actually happend to an army commanded by Persian emperor Cyrus's son. Heard on hardcore history kings of kings part II. 28:49.

A character who was born on a battlefield. War is in their blood.

There's a girl and she's great but she married this loser weirdo. They're trying to get pregnant but her eggs aren't having it. It starts out live action to establish context and then it's an animated war movie about her eggs defending themselves against the semen invaders. Feature length animated?

A woman is married to a giant fat man who has a heart attack while on top of her. So he traps her under him and he's dying and she's suffocating. Kind of like Gerald's Game. That's not much of an escape movie. I think she just dies there. So it could be the backstory of a ghost or something. Medieval times maybe. The fat guy is a king or a wealthy merchant.

The characters are on the road, need a place to rest. They spy an odd cottage. It used to be a wizard's cottage. It's sentient. And evil. If they open the door it sets them on a path that leads right back to the cottage.

an okd fridge haunted by the ghost of a kid who was forced into it and sucfocated. A mini fridge. So it's kind of cute.

In the future, you can get paid by naming your kid after a product. Scifi.

Gimmick. The story begins with the latter half of a sentences, and ends with with the first half of the sentence. So it's like a cycle.

a culture that believes when you die in this world youre reborn in the other, and when you die in that world youre reborn in this one. tradition invented by a guy who had a group of warriors, like a cult of battle, and he instilled this belief to make them fearless. based on the galic people

Character: A hag. Slatternly Rose Sludge.

Character: A rider. He's a corpses. Crows sit on him and pick at his flesh.

Character: A writer who gets hired by a gang to do their press releases. Because it's the old west and none of the others could read it. And it opens in the scene where the one guy who could read gets killed. "Alright let's draft a press release." "Jimmy was the only one who could read." So they take this guy along, who is on the train. He is a writer, and this is kind of dream for him, to have the chance to report on and biograph the outlaw.

idea: the dark side of the force. the legion fargo esque star wars series. TV or comic.

Character: a toothless vampire who has to drink the blood of his victims theough a straw.

he's kissing her hand. it's romantic. then we find out that the hand he loves so is severed. Horror scene.

The story of Crane and Shibboleth. Starring whoever is savvy enough to not go into his debt/suspect him from the beginning. By the end, this person is one of the only people who hasn't sold his soul to Crane in one way or another. Inspired by *Midnight Mass* and *Salem's Lot*.

a family meal, maybe extended family. everybody's so hungry they just stuff themselves in a fury. then when the dust settles they realize the baby is missing. realize they ate her. could be humans or a family of trolls or something. Ends with, "Where's [name]?" #horror #comedy #scene One guy's stomach starts growling. The baby rips out of him or something. Short film.

write rancid mayhem as a serial. when it starts, rance works for hell as a hunter of rogue demons. then he comes to want to get out of hell. so he makes a deal with heaven to work for them and in exchange, they'll let him back in before armageddon. so in the first episode we have to establish that he's miserable, and that he doesn't know how he ended up here, he's jaded and feeling lost, no purpose. and he finds out that armageddon is coming. that's the first major incident of first episode. so he goes to the angels and makes a deal. so what's the cliffhanger. hell assigns him to find the traitor (which is him). at the end, as armageddon is happening, he goes to close the deal but heaven doesn't let him in? or he arrives where it's supposed to be and they've gone? zadkiel is there to explain things. or maybe just to rub it in. then he leaves rance on earth, which has become hell. #horror #serial #fantasy #premise 

if coffee beans were people. that's it. that's the whole thing. we watch them get poured into a grinder, ground up. tamped, poured, etc. there's lot of screaming. then a giant coffee beans sips them. ahh, yummy. i love the way you make it. then we're just in the coffee beans' lives. he's shy, he asks the barista out or something. #sketch #comedy #animation #premise 

angels have been keeping up the farce of god forever. he’s been absent a long time. but they’re doing a shit job of it. people are starting to suspect that god left. have to figure out how to get people to believe again. #premise Part of the Rance serial?

a jewish kid who on his bar mitzvah day is actually welcomed into the jewish global kabal. #scene 

high steaks #comedy #sketch #premise 

also, a short film where an angel is diligently saving souls. hes very lonely. he sends reports and hears nothing back. or only a word back. at the end he is called back to heaven to find it empty. it was all pointless. #premise Part of the Rance serial?

all the characters are deaf from being in gunfights all the time

one gunslinger mows down a hundred enemies by quick drawing and fanning the hammer. he never reloads #western #comedy #sketch 

a gang robs a train by blowing it up like in _butch cassidy_. one of the members is killed. they plan a press release to leave at the scene but realize that the only one of them who could write was the one who got blown. they ask the accountant or whatever aboard the train if he can write. #western #comedy #scene 

Give the gift of life. Become a necromancer today! #fantasy #comedy Advertisement.

Dnd: The players have to play in-game version of dungeons and dragons. Their character in this game are themselves in real life. So it’s like a mirror thing sort of.

Shooting stars. Stars shooting guns. Stars being shot with guns. Pigeon shooting but with stars. Shooting stars like heroin. All the same but with stars as in celebrities. #comedy #sketch #animation #premise 

A cowboy is betrayed, but he brought back to life by a scientist. When he is brought back, he is only able to utter one word: the name of the one against whom he seeks revenge. And whatever that name is is the name of the movie. And people think that's his name so that's what they call him. #western #premise 

A young gunslinger. He’s good and he knows it. He goes on a quest to find his idol, and older gunslinger. He wants to kill him, basically do that he can say he killed him. when he finds him the gunslinger agrees to duel him if he helps him on his quest. Over the story the young becomes disenchanted with the old, who is slightly crazy and farts a lot. And the young wonders how if he’s as good as he is is this still all that really waits for him? He’s disappointed as he realizes what lies in store for him, if he lives that long. #western #premise I see this being a movie. Because I think they go on this quest, achieve it or at least it wraps up, then they part ways, maybe the old guy betrays him. And finally the young guy tracks him down and kills him. Maybe the old guy is pretty far gone, pretty viscious. Or maybe he's just a survivor. But I think it has to end with a duel. But maybe an unothodox one. The old guy has no intention of playing by the rules. So he sets up booby traps or has a sniper on the kid as they duel. 

A mother listens to the heartbeat of her dead child inside the body of the person it was donated to. #drama #scene 

an adventurer whose father was a pirate lord. They are searching for his buried treasure.  But when they find it, it is not riches, but rather a note addressed to them. It’s from the father, and it tells them that if they managed to find the letter they must have learned everything the father wanted to teach them, which was the great treasure he could offer. the father must have bequeathed them a map, or at least clues to get them start on the trail. Gave them a series of obstacles to overcome before they can find the treasure. The main character has to just be the most brutal pirate ever, but it’s all just because he’s super insecure and just wants to live up to his father. I think this would make a good comic. And that would allow us to bring in some fantasy elements as well. #fantasy #characters #comics #premise #scene This is basically a boy named Sue. The father is there when he finds the letter. Then they go back to back and fight the bad guys. Which are maybe the crew? Maybe the first mate betrayed the father back in the day and left him for dead. And all this time the son has hated the father because the first mate has brainwashed him. Could be a fun prose short story as well.

Nick cage plays every character. #comedy #premise 

god drops the book of life in a river. #fantasy #comedy 

a pest control company, only the pests are humans. advanced/giant aliens took over earth, or something evovled...? and now humans are like mice. kind of like that french movie with the blue people. #scifi #comedy #horror 

first date. guy just cant get enough of the water. “you gotta try the water here. its spring fed” #comedy #sketch 

The party return to somewhere theyve been to find that they are worshipped as heroes or perhaps even gods. They don't even have to have been there before in-game. You could have them remember going through this town that at the time was a absolutely zero consequence to them. #rpg #dnd #fantasy #premise 

A society where everyone worships an individual god of their own design. #fantasy #setting 

Open on an idyllic scene of a child making a wish. Then cut to this chaos. Someone who **grants wishes for a living**. the paper pusher or the wish designer? the wish designer seems more interested (since they have to remold reality and stuff without breaking anything) but a frazzled paper-pusher is good too. you could call the story, the department of wishes. He creates a paradox and if he can’t fix it all of reality with blip out of existence. This could be a feature, high anxiety like uncut gems. #fantasy #character #premise There's a ticking clock, because the univeser is going to end. There's a quest, which is to rearrange reality to make that not happen. You could call it "Why we don't do wishes any more"

Ensemble whodunnit. like hateful eight, and then there were none, the ninth guest, clue. a mysterious host brings them together. one of them is a murderer. Perhaps it is a party thrown for the realm’s greatest heroes. #fantasy #dnd #rpg #mystery #premise 

Monster: The watchmakullit

the queen's right hand. In which is trapped the soul of her late husband. Or something. It advises her. She frequently plays with her hair or ear, so that the hand can whisper to her. #fantasy 

the outlaw club. all famous outlaws are brought together to pull off some job. rob the kingdom of heaven or something. #scifi #fantasy Comic.

the halfing pirtate who thinks he's been cursed to be small. but it's really just a fantasy he's made for himself to protect his ego, presumably because his father or something hated him for being small. #fantasy #characters #nautical The bantam reaver.

the day the milk went bad. it starts like committing massshootings and stuff. animation. a humor poem. same cadenace as “american pie,” “the day the music died.” #comedy #sketch 

the bantam reaver. a tiny but ferocious pirate #fantasy #characters #nautical 

The devil buys souls on the internet. #fantasy 

Siamese twins. Except they don't have equal control over the body. One of them is small and warped. More like a growth. So he is always at the mercy of his "older" brother, who controls the body. He's always trying to get his brother to do things (like seduce someone, for instance) so that he can feel bodily pleasure. #fantasy #characters 

serial killer groupie. dreams of being killed by him. he keeps her around because its no fun when its what they want, and also perhaps he starts to develop feelings. #crime #comedy #characters 

reverse muggers they corner you and give you a bunch of stuff. #comedy #sketch #crime 

A ghost who haunts a telephone. #fantasy 

**A phantom ship**. has been haunting the seas for hundreds of years. perhaps the ship itself is a ghost. it has a hold over the crew, who wish to be free. crewed by ghosts. or it’s just floating abandoned? probably the former. let’s say you can hear ghostly cackles, or the barking orders of a captain long dead. #fantasy #horror #nautical 

The party plays dnd. in game, as their real world selves. #rpg #fantasy #dnd 

Sketch: octagenarians vs zombies.

**The Inn on the Road.** When you enter it after a certain hour, the inn is populated by characters from a mural that hangs in it. If you stay long enough, you become trapped in the mural world. #fantasy 

**mission from a god.** all the heroes get killed at beginning of the episode. then they meet the God who has arranged their death so that he can use their spirits in a battle. The way Odin would have ended with eirik. make the deaths comedic and at the beginning of the session ask them to trust you so that people aren’t too upset. once they complete the mission for the God they are restored to the material plane and their bodies. but maybe that’s an ordeal in itself. The god promises them that when they agree to help him but he leaves out how difficult it will actually be to reclaim their bodies. based on the song of king eirik #fantasy #dnd 

day in the life of a master interrogator. imagine the hours. getting up in the middle of the night just to get the drop on someone. charming but evil, like mr. croup and vandehaar. Gets up, makes himself coffee, yawns, stretches, says hi to his cat. Then goes and tortures a dude. He suffers an existential crisis because he’s not getting anywhere. His victim is real resistant (or maybe he doesn’t know anything). Maybe in the end it turns out that it was a case of mistaken identity. Or maybe not. But the victim wears him down until he has nothing left. interrogator just keeps asking over and over again, “where is it?” kind of the is it safe thing. only we’re in the torturers perspective. pairs with guantanamo workplace #comedy 

just a brain. someone removies all barriers to consciousness. so they are just a brain and nervous system. so they can think clearly without distractions. #scifi #characters 

Character: Based on dietrich eckhart. nazi who ended up in an asylum and put on his weird plays using the inmates as actors.

Character and superpower: Someone who can literally disappear into his own head. Maybe he gets lost. Has to find his way out.

Horror character and situation: imaginary friend who moves from kid to kid until they forget him, so the. he moves on to the next. could be almost kind of weird and creepy. animated or a guy in a suit? kind of like inside out.

Premise: based on sullivans reward hellboy. charcaters given a mysterious house. You can start as they wake up. fall asleep wake up and find theyve done terrible things. portrait of the houses original owner. rip the portrait away and there's a beating heart behind it. sort of like a haunted house dungeon crawl. Combine with sentient wizard's cabin idea.

Premise: **actor kidnapped.** A famous actor is captured by some entity to play a role.

**alien aphrodisiac.** an alien species seeks a particular human body part to sell as aphrodisiacs and miracles cures. kind of like humans do with whale bones and shit. Could be like this horrifying predator-esque movie and then that's the reason it's happening. #scifi #comedy #premise 

**become ghosts.** pcs take spectral potions and haunt somebody. hired to get rid of somebody? to get back at somebody? a pretty small adventure. or they're killed and go on a quest to find their bodies again. #rpg #fantasy #premise 

**beer run.** the story rick told about the beer run to the college students. throwing all the ice in the trunk so it wouldnt get cold but then it melting on the way flooding the cab so he blew a few holes in it with his .45 #comedy #scene 

**in someone else's game.** The party finds out that they are characters in someones dnd game. #rpg #premise 

Character: **blackmailing priest.** blackmailing priest. uses what he learns in confession to blackmail congregants. #drama #crime #character #premise 

**brunch money.** gimme your brunch money! #sketch #comedy #premise 

Character, situation: **coyote man.** a man who adopts captures feral cats to feed to a coyote.

Rpg, hook: give your characters a company of mercenaries or companions of some sort have heroes go on side mission and when they return their companions have been all murdered. Perhaps a betrayal.

Character: **death's intern.**

Character, situation, fantasy: Death has to find his horse.

Character: **burn down the globe.** a demon whose tradition every few centuries is to burn down the globe theater.

**two families in the wilderness.** one human. the other doppelgangers. the impetus would the human (?) family discovering that there is another family living nearby by that looks exactly like them. #fantasy #horror #premise I imagine this happens in pioneer times? Like the Witch.

**tarantino paradox.** man realizes it is mathematically impossible for tarantino to have seen as many movies as he has. has an existential crisis. no one else cares. #sketch #comedy #scifi #premise He goes looking for other paradoxes. Where does it lead?

**Father/son tyrants.** father and son. father is an evil tyrant emperor. son is…his son. sci fi. comedic space odyseey father son bonding as they travel the galaxy conquering civilizations and learning about each other and themselves along the way. so its a father son movie. or show.

## Lines

Once upon a time, on a planet, in a counry, in a city, on a street, in a house, in a room, under a stairwell, in a coffee can, there lived...

That's a lie funny enough to tell.
