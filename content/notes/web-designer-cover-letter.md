I was very excited to happen across Contra's job post on Indeed. I'm a web designer and developer with about a year's experience building sites for small businesses, professionals, and creatives. I'm looking for my first junior role where I can apply my current skill set and continue learning and growing into my career.

I began learning web development in October 2023 through a combination of online courses, documentation, and lots and lots of practice. Since then, I've developed a thorough knowledge of HTML, CSS, web performance, accessibility, along with a solid understanding of JavaScript and accessibility. I'm particularly enthusiastic about design and performance. I love building beautiful sites that are a pleasure to use.

Though I'm still new to this field, I'm constantly learning new skills and technologies. I'm forever deepening my knowledge of CSS and the core web technologies and standards. I'm excited about the opportunity to continue my growth with Contra!

You can see my previous work in my portfolio at https://samfeldstein.xyz/websites/. And if you'd like to see the fun web version of my resume, you can find that at https://samfeldstein.xyz/resume/.

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. If you have any questions about my experience, I'm happy to answer them. You can reach me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,

Sam Feldstein
