To Whom It May Concern:

I am a freelance web developer and part-time Psychology student. I'm writing to apply for the Temporary Communications Assistant position posted on the CU Boulder jobs page. I hold a degree in English and Creative Writing from the University of Iowa, and I've held a variety of jobs that have sharpened my communication, technical, and organizational skills. I'd be glad to bring those skills to the Communications Assistant role.

As you can see from my résumé, my work history is a little all over the place. The ultra-short story there is: I used to want to be a screenwriter, I went to school for it, didn't like it, withdrew, moved to West Texas, managed a coffee shop, wrote for the local paper, moved out of West Texas, traveled around while taking web development courses, wound up in Boulder, had an epiphany, rented a place here, began taking Psychology courses, walked to Rayback, ordered a coffee, sat down, found your job posting, wrote this cover letter. And that about brings us up to speed.

The jobs I couldn't fit on my résumé include but are not limited to: Horseback Riding Instructor, Library Assistant, Shopify Store Manager, Web Consultant, and Gallery Attendant. And if "Studio Fixer But for a Coffee Shop" was a job title, I'd have held that, too.

My technical skills include Google Analytics, SEO, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, and Google Sheets. I'm a skilled writer and a decent talker, even in front of a crowd. I don't know if that's relevant to this role, but in a world where a substantial number of people report being less afraid of premature death than public speaking, it seems worth mentioning.

When I'm not writing effusive cover letters, I'm taking an Intro to Psychology course at Yale through Coursera. I came to psychology by way of *The Design of Everyday Things,* *Nudge,* *Thinking, Fast and Slow,* and most recently, *The Undoing Project.* I'm also interested in behavioral economics and ed-tech/learning-augmentation. Anki, Readwise, and Obsidian are a few of my favorite tools. I'm writing this cover letter with Zettlr.

Assuming the course goes well, I plan go back to school to study Psychology. In the meantime, I'm trying to get as close to academia as I can, hence this application.

If you have a moment, I'd love to direct you to my website ([https://samfeldstein.xyz](https://samfeldstein.xyz)) and my online notebook ([https://notebook.samfeldstein.xyz](https://notebook.samfeldstein.xyz)), because I don't know any better way to demonstrate my writing ability, my mind's inner workings, and my dedication to the retention, organization, and free distribution of knowledge. Please note that the notes in the notebook just that, and therefore often sloppy. You can find polished writing samples on my blog ([https://samfeldstein.xyz/blog/](https://samfeldstein.xyz/blog/)) and my Published Writing page ([https://notebook.samfeldstein.xyz/notes/published-writing/](https://notebook.samfeldstein.xyz/notes/published-writing/)).

I know my path has been non-traditional, as has this cover letter, but I believe I could put my skills to good use in the Communications Assistant role. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward very much to discussing the position further.

Sincerely,

Sam Feldstein
