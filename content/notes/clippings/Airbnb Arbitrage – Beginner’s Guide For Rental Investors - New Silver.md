If you were renting a 2-bedroom apartment for $2,000 a month and you sub-let it on Airbnb as per the Airbnb arbitrage method. You could generate $150 per night in rent, which would mean that you could pay off your rent after 2 weeks of letting out the apartment. The rest of the month would then be profit.

If you rented the apartment out for 28 days of the month, you’d generate a total income of $4,200 for the month. If you used $2,000 to pay your rent, you’d be left with a $2,200 profit. Some of this could be used to maintain the property, and the rest could be saved or put towards something else.
