Sometimes "why" seems like a nonquestion. I don't think it makes sense to ask "why" alocohol inhibits our inhibitors. The chances were good that some substance or another could do that, and alocohol just happens to be that substance.

By the same token, I don't think it makes much sense to ask "why" the laws of physics work. They work because if they didn't, nothing would exist. Things make sense because if they didn't, they wouldn't.

Another way to put it is, what's the alternative? If the laws of physics break down, evertyhing implodes and nobody's left to ask the question. So they have to work, because if they didn't, they wouldn't.
