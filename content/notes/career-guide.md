1. Choose a [field](notes/private/my-interests.md)
2. See if you’re a fit
3. Further your education

If you aren’t sure, which field interests you most, go with the most flexible option:

> The less sure you are about what to do, the more important it is to choose options that give you more options in the future. I call this “staying upwind.” If you're unsure whether to major in math or economics, for example, choose math. Math is upwind of economics in the sense that it will be easier to switch later from math to economics than from economics to math.
