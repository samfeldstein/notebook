Hi, I'm Sam. I'm new to Boulder, and I'm looking to get involved in the dance community here. I've taken a handful of West Coast Swing classes before, but I've been out of practice for a few months now and I can't wait to get back into it.

I'm planning on attending the Thursday night class, but I also saw that you take volunteers and I thought I'd reach out about that in the meantime. I spun up this little website as a way to say hello.

I've been taking web development courses for the past year or so, and I'm currently looking for work in that field. I'd love to become a web development volunteer for the Avalon, if you have any such openings.

Of course, if you don't have any such openings, no problem. Just thought I'd put my name in the hat. Or my hat in the ring. Or some other expression involving putting hats in things or things in hats.

In any case, I'll be there this coming Thursday (Oct. 17) for dance lessons, and would be happy to discuss this further.

I'm very excited to meet all of you soon. See you Thursday!

Cheers,

Sam
