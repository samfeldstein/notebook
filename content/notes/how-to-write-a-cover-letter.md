Cover letters are an opportunity to express your personality. They know what your experience is, they got that from your resume. So the cover letter is your chance to show them what kind of person you are.

Be funny. Reading through cover letters has gotta be mind-numbing. Make your cover letter the highlight of the recruiter's morning.

That's my theory, anyway.
