Sam received his degree in English and Creative Writing from the University of Iowa before going on to study screenwriting at Chapman University in Southern California. He taught himself to code after deciding he needed a website to showcase his work. He started West Coast Swing dancing in the summer of 2024, and it has now taken over his life. When he isn't dancing, he's probably eating. When he isn't eating, he's probably reading. When he isn't reading, he's probably asleep. When he finds the time, Sam also enjoys live music, going to the movies, and writing about himself in the third person.

## First person narrative style

Hi, I'm Sam. I've been writing one thing or another for over twenty years. It began in elementary school with short stories and numerous attempted fantasy novels. In high school I fell in love with film. After completing my degree in English and Creative Writing at the University of Iowa, I moved to Southern California to study screenwriting at Chapman University's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts.

Over time, my interest turned to prose, nonfiction, and personal writing. I rode out the pandemic in Far West Texas, where I spent my days writing essays, short stories, and the occasional article for the local newspaper. To date, I've been published in several small outlets, including the popular horror fiction podcast Tales to Terrify.

In my teaching, I try to deemphasize the formal tangibles (grammar, spelling, syntax, diction, five-paragraph structure, and so on). Not to say they don't matter, but they are superficial and easily addressed. I'm much more concerned with the quality of the thought that goes into the piece. Given the choice between a boring work that adheres to "proper" form and an interesting work that doesn't, I'll take the latter every time. Interesting writing is interesting not because the author followed the rules but because they said what they meant.

The other reason I'm suspicious of formality is that it implies there's a "right" way to do things, and that just isn't true. There are as many ways to write as there are writers. The best approach is the approach that works for you. As I see it, my job is to help you find that approach.

## Other clever thoughts

Sam has a hard time writing bios, because usually the way you start a bio is by saying what you are, and Sam doesn't think people *are* things. He thinks people *do* things. So here are some of the things Sam does:
