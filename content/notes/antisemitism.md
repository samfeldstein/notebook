## Why the Jews?

> How come people have stronger emotions about Ibram X. Kendi (or Chris Rufo) than about Kim Jong-un or whoever's committing the latest genocide in Sudan? It's not because you're American and naturally care about American affairs - how about that Brazilian judge who banned Elon Musk's X? It's because all those guys are part of your psychodrama and some Sudanese psychopath isn't.

There seems to be this sense that the Jews should be better than other people because they were nearly wiped out eighty years ago. And since they don't know better, so the thinking goes, then they must deserve everything they get.

[Matti Friedman](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/israel-insider-guide):

> When journalists cover the Jews’ war as more worthy of attention than any other, when they portray the Jews of Israel as the party obviously in the wrong, when they omit all possible justifications for the Jews’ actions and obscure the true face of their enemies, **what they are saying to their readers—whether they intend to or not—is that Jews are the worst people on earth.**

This is how you retroactively justify the Shoah.

## Silence

As in music, the notes you don't play mean as much as those you do. If you loudly decry Israel but have nothing to say about antisemitism, that is a statement, and it is not one your Jewish friends find comforting.

## The Holocaust

I sometimes get the impression that people think antisemitism began and ended with the Holocaust. It's like they think the Holocaust cured the world of antisemitism, as though so horrible a mistake could not possibly be repeated.

**But people have been killing Jews for beings Jews for as long as there have been Jews.**
