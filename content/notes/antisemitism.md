## The problem with "the Jews"

Referring to “the Jews” implies a collective entity with a shared goal. The implications are sinister, and it enables sentences like "the Jews control Hollywood." Nobody refers to “the Christians.” That would be weird.

So I think I'm against this phrase as a rule.

## Why Jews?

> How come people have stronger emotions about Ibram X. Kendi (or Chris Rufo) than about Kim Jong-un or whoever's committing the latest genocide in Sudan? It's not because you're American and naturally care about American affairs - how about that Brazilian judge who banned Elon Musk's X? It's because all those guys are part of your psychodrama and some Sudanese psychopath isn't.

## Jewish excellence and hypocrisy

Jews dare aspire to be better than they are, and so when they fail they look like hypocrites.

The failure of others doesn’t look as bad because they never aspired to more.
