A subnet's range is determined by its network address and [subnet mask](notes/subnet-masks.md) (or CIDR prefix). The range starts with the lowest address (all host bits set to 0) and ends with the highest address (all host bits set to 1). The highest address is the [broadcast address](notes/broadcast-address.md).
