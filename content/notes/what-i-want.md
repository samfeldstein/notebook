When we talk about what we want to do with our lives, we're usually talking about a career. When we talk about a career, we're usually talking about a way to make money.

That's a problem for me. Because I don't want to make money. And what I mean by that is that none of the things I like to do involve making money. I like going to the movies. I like drinking coffee at coffee shops. I reading and learning. I like taking photos. I like dancing West Coast Swing. I like building little websites for myself and people I love.

None of these are financially lucrative.

I wish I *did* want to make money for its own sake. The people who want to make money are positioned to do well. So how do you make making money an activity you enjoy. Maybe you flip the script. Instead of looking at what you like doing and trying to think of ways to make money at it, instead make making money the activity, and then try different ways to do it. Turn it into a game. Experiment. See what works.

But the **money is an obscuring factor**. I think we have to get away from that. Forget the money, and just think about what you _want._ Then make a plan to get it.

I want to master dance. I want to master jiujitsu. I want to see movies at the theater. I want to learn guitar. When I ask myself what I want, I think I expect the answer to be bigger than this. And so I overlook these things. They're right in front of me and I don't even see them. But if I ask myself what I'm interested in, this is it.

That doesn't bespeak much ambition, which bothers me. You're asking a big question here. The question pertains to the meaning of life. You're asking why we're here, and how best to spent our limited time on Earth.

There is the ambitious part of me that wants to do something great. And then there's the other part of me that wants to aim smaller. To be part of a community, to contribute to it however I can, and leave things better than I found them. That is noble, I think, and also right, but it's a little underwhelming. But ultimately I think the fact that it feels that way is a problem. We've all been raised to believe we can and should do whatever we want, even if the things we want have a very low chance of success. It's of course true that if you don't try you'll definitely fail. But how many people waste their whole lives trying, or pretending to try, and ultimately fail to make any difference at all, big or small?

It's good to be ambitious. But I think most people, myself included, suffer from an ambition that looks suspiciously like entitlement when looked at from a different angle. We believe we deserve the best, and so we refuse to do anything else, even if the best is out of reach. So instead we do nothing. We work in coffee shops, taking jobs that should rightfully belong to high-schoolers. We aim high, and fall well short of our target, but we keep looking up, and in so doing fail to see what's right in front of us. Most of us will never be Steve Jobs or Brad Pitt. But maybe, if we learned to settle for somewhat less, we could become the Steve Jobs or the Brad Pitt of our neighborhood.

But even that's ambitious. So what do we have a right to expect, and what should we try to achieve. I have always tried to be realistic about my abilities. I'm well-aware of my limitations. That doesn't stop me from trying to push those limits, but if I don't manage my expectations, I'll be discontented my entire life. And I don't *want* to be discontented my entire life.

I want to try things and achive them. To do that, you need a conviction that I have always lacked. You need *chutzpah*. You need to know what you want the energy to go after it, and the savvy to get it. I have had every advantage a person could want. And I have absolutely nothing to show for it. What does that say about me? I don't like to think about it.

My problem is that I flip flop. Sometimes I think I'd sacrifice everything for the right goal. Other times I just want to make a living. Enough to live in a modest but comfortable home, with a nice kitchen and yard so I can have people over for cookouts. And then I think, what would that life amount to? And then we're back to the original question: Why are we here?

What is ephemeral happiness worth? What is kindness worth? I've personally always held kindess is high esteem, but that's very conveneient, because I've always been good at being kind.

If we had nothing else to worry about, wouldn't we be concerned with making life as fun as possible? Every innovation attempts to solve a problem. What if there were no problems? What would the problem be? The challenge at that point is to make life just like life, but more so. A lot of people in America and the First World are already at this point. They don't really have much to worry about. They might not be rich, but they can complain about how expensive everything is while eathing a $23 hamburger. So once we've met our basic needs, what's the next step? I think we need a challenge or we start to atrophy. We have more or less everything we could want, and yet we're distasfied. And because we're dissatisfied, we're angry. Where does the dissatisfaction come from?
