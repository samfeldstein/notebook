Some people are for it, some against. As usual, I think both extremes are wrong, and the answer lies somewhere in the middle.

Is AI useful? Definitely. Is it a gamechanger? Maybe it could be, but probably not in it's current for. But neither is it completely useless. It's a tool, to be used when needed, as all tools are.

I do wonder what effect building things with AI has on your problem-solving skills. If you spend all your time tryhing to explain yourself to a dumb robot, is it possible that you'll actually get pretty good at explaining yourself? In other words, could building things with AI improve your [[problem-solving]] skills?

## Building things with AI is disatisfying

AI is useful, but building things with it is disatisfying. I think that's because it switches the problem from "How do I write this code so that the app does what I want it do?" to "How do I get this stupid robot to understand what I'm saying?", which is a much less interesting question.
