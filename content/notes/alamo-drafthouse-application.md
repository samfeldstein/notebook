## Cover Letter

To the Alamo Team,

I just moved to Boulder and I'm looking for part-time work whiel I take courses in web development. The best job I ever had wasn't a job at all, but a volunteer position with the Frida Cinema, an arthouse theater in Santa Ana, CA. When I saw you were hiring for the bar, I had to throw my hat in the ring.

The great thing about the Frida was that it was more than just a theater. It was also a community. I'd love to be a part of something like that again, and I think the Alamo is the perfect opportunity.

I just moved to Colorado, so I don't have a food safety or alcoholo certifcation, but I'm happy to get them ASAP if you feel like I'd be a good fit.
