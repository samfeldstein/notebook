I don't know what this movie is trying to say about the healthcare system other than that actually helping people seems to be the last thing on its mind.

I also don't understand what the company stands to gain by having so many people in its pocket, but it must be a a viable business model or IRL credit card companies wouldn't do it.

In other news, this is the same story as *Logan's Run.* Man works for The Man. He enforces a system in which The Man profits and the People suffer. He believes that without this system, Order would crumble and Chaos would reign. Therefore, by upholding it, he is Good.

But then, by a twist of Fate, Man becomes a victim of that very system, and it dawns on him that the system sucks. So rather than submit to it, he runs.

He descends to the lower strata of society and meets the People, one of whom happens to be a beautiful woman. From her, Man learns how to love and be loved, and how to live for someone other than himself. Together, they go back, stick it to (kill) the Man, and upend (blow up) the System.

I don't remember if that's exactly how it goes in *Logan's Run*, but a lot of the major beats are the same. And of course in *Repo Men* they don't really do any of the revolutionary stuff because it turns out Jude Law's been in a coma ever since Forest Whitaker hit him in the head with an industrial chain.

## Notes

A couple other movies with similar structure and overtones are *The Fisher King* and *Minority Report.*
