It's satisfying to "build" websites and programs "by hand." But the better AI gets, the less necessary (and practical) it will be, and the programmer's role will change, insomcuh as they won't be a programmer at all. They'll be an AI Supervisor. Their job will be to tell the AI what to do, and then check its work.

For more interesting projects, there will be more of a balance. The relationship will be symbiotic. The AI will do a lot of the legwork, but the human will have all the big ideas.

## Building things with AI is disatisfying

I think the direction predicted above is inevitable, but at the same time, I find building things with AI disatisfrying. I think that's because it switches the problem from "How do I write this code so that the app does what I want it do?" to "How do I get this stupid robot to understand what I'm saying?", which is a much less interesting question.

But this only applies if I'm trying to build an entire site using AI. But if I only use AI when I need to, like when I'm trying to solve a very specific problem, I'm only too happy for its help.
