In May 2021, antisemitic violence in America spiked. May happens to be both Jewish American Heritage Month and Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. At the time, anti-Asian hate crimes were also on the rise. NPR responded by posting an infographic about what to do if you witness an anti-Asian hate crime. But they had nothing to say, apparently, about what to do if you witness antisemitism.

How are Jews supposed to take that? And what's NPR's problem? For my part, I think they were afraid of backlash. Which begs the question: **Why should anybody be afraid of backlash for speaking out against antisemitism?**

Let me answer a question with a question: How many times have you spoken out against anti-Jewish hate? If the answer is zero, and you're the kind of person inclined to post about such things in the first place, how do you reconcile that? Either you don't care much about Jew-hatred, or you're afraid of backlash, too.

As in music, **the notes you don't play mean as much as those you do.** If you loudly decry Israel but have nothing to say about antisemitism, that is a statement, and it is not one your Jewish friends find comforting.
