I've always stayed in my comfort zone. I never did anything hard, out of some combination of fear and laziness. I never liked that about myself, but it took me a long time to do anything about it. I basically spent the first twenty-five years of my life working up the nerve to do anything interesting.

Almost every decision I've made in the last year (Workaway, taking up dance) has been a direct assault on my lack of confidence. This is a theme for me. **Pretty much every real decision I've made I've made out of a desire to change something I don't like about myself.**
