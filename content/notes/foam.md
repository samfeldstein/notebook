## Issues

### Publishing

Foam offers [support for GitHub pages](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/user/publishing/publish-to-github-pages), but I was having trouble figuring it out. In any case, my time would probably be better spent trying to figure out how to [[foam-and-astro|integrate with Astro]].

Also, even on GitHub Pages, [backlinks do not render](https://seldstein.github.io/second-brain/docs/features/backlinking). Not essential for publishing, but would be very nice.

### Other

- Applying a default note template to notes created by wikilinks?
- When I create a note, I'd like the filename to be formatted automatically.
- Have Foam render titles from frontmatter?

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[foam-and-astro|integrate with Astro]: foam-and-astro "Foam and Astro"
