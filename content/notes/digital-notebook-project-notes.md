## Site Infrastructure

On the local level, this site is a collection of markdown files that I read and write with VS Code. The files are processed by [Foam](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode), which draws all the connections between tags and backlinks and renders them in a side panel.

The idea is to draw connections between ideas, even (especially?), disparate ones.

The site is generated by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and deployed with [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) as a subdomain of my [main site](https://samfeldstein.xyz).

## Wishlist

- Search
- Render links (backlinks or otherwise, external and internal)
