## Site Infrastructure

On the local level, this site is a collection of markdown files that I read and write with VS Code. The files are processed by [Foam](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode), which draws all the connections between tags and backlinks and renders them in a side panel.

The idea is to draw connections between ideas, even (especially?), disparate ones.

The site is generated by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/seldstein/notebook/tree/main), and [published with Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) as a subdomain of my [main site](https://samfeldstein.xyz).

## Private Notes

**I want to keep some notes private, but I want to keep them with my public notes so I can link to them in Foam.**

The trick is to **make sure private notes are filtered from the Eleventy's build output and git commits**.

### Exclude from build output

Another way to do this is to keep a folder outside the content folder. That way, 11ty won't even think about touching it. This requires you to run Foam from your 11ty workspace. I don't like this solution, because I like to run Foam from my content folder. So I need the `public` folder to live there.

Mark notes private or have a folder? A folder seems easier to keep track of. Maybe add support for both. That way there's less room for error and they have options.

### Exclude from git

If your repo is private, this step is optional. But if there's a chance you'll ever make your repo public, or if you don't want your private notes on the internet at all, this step is necessary.

Hiding private notes 

- Add `notes/private` to `.gitignore`.
- Update 404 to account for this, or even better, show them a custom 404 for private notes so they know this is exactly what happened.

We need to show the user a page other than 404 when they try to access a private note.

I don't know that this method is foolproof, 

to make private notes work, remove _/site from remote and make sure it's in gitignore
