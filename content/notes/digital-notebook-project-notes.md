My notebook (the website you are currently on) is a wiki-like digital knowledge base. I manage the files with [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io). The site is generated by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/seldstein/notebook/tree/main), and [published with Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) as a subdomain of my [main site](https://samfeldstein.xyz).

The idea behind a wiki-like knowledge-base is to make it easier draw connections between ideas, even (especially?) disparate ones. This is facilitated by backlinks, which are links that link to the current page.

## Wikilinks

Backlinks are almost universally handled with wikilinks. (Though I don't really understand why. I don't see what's special about wikilinks beyond the syntax, and I don't actually find the syntax all that convenient. I must be missing something.) The problem is that wikilinks aren't a native markdown feature, so any given site generator (like Eleventy) isn't going to know what to do with them.

Luckily for me, Juan Frank had already figured this out in his [Eleventy Foam Template](https://github.com/juanfrank77/foam-eleventy-template). What his solution didn't account for, as far as I could tell, was placeholder text. So a wikilink that looked like this `[[note|link text]]` would render like that on the page. With [Claude's](https://claude.ai) help, I added a regex to remove the pipe and the text to the left of it.

That's pretty much all there was to it. What the site doesn't do at the moment is render backlinks on the page. This isn't a disaster, because I see all those in Foam, but it'd be nice if they were on the site, too.
