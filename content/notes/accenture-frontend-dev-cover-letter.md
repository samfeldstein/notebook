To the Accenture Staff:

I'm a self-taught web developer with about a year's experience building small business and personal sites, and I'm looking for my first professional role. I began learning HTML and CSS a couple of years ago so I could build a site to showcase my writing (I used to want to be an author). At some point it dawned on me that I enjoyed the coding more than the writing, and here we are.

When I began learning web development, I decided to focus on the fundamentals. I figured a solid grounding in semantic HTML, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript would give me the knowledge I needed to progress. Since then, I've built websites from scratch, with static site generators, and with JavaScript frameworks like Astro. I'm attracted to lean, sustainable web architecture. My favorite saying is "measure twice, cut once."

I've used modern CSS (flexbox, grid, etc.) in almost every project I've worked on. I've freelanced as a WordPress developer, and I've worked a number of service and management jobs that have given me excellent communication and organizational skills.

I'm extremely proud of how far I've come in a short amount of time, and I'm excited to take the next step in my new career path at a high-impact organization like Accenture.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to discussing the position further.

Sincerely,

Sam Feldstein

## Direct Message

Hi, I just applied to the Front End Web Developer position with Accenture. I just wanted to reach out and introduce myself.

I'm new to the field, and I'm aware that I'm competing against candidates with more impressive credentials than I have. But I believe what I have that they don't is a drive to improve, a hunger for knowledge, and a systematic approach to both.

For example, I built a virtual notebook on top of my Obsidian vault so that I could facilitate the process of drawing specific connections between subjects, and spark unique ideas.

You can find that and other projects in my portfolio:

I hope these projects will serve as a testament to my ability to learn and improve quickly. I know I have potential, and I'm eager to realize it at a high-impact organization like Accenture.

Thank you very much for reading this. If you have any questions for me, I'm happy to answer. I look forward to discussing the position further.

Sincerely,

Sam Feldstein
