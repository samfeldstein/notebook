## Past Work

### Web Developer and Designer - Prairie Rose Arena

I made a custom website for Prairie Rose Arena, an equestrian event center in Elkhart, IA. My goal was to build a site that was fast, responsive, accessible, and eye-catching.

I'd never done any kind of graphic design before this, so I was really flying by the seat of my pants here. I wanted the design to be unique and nice to look at. After many hours spent browsing fonts and drafting in Figma, I'm pleased to say I think I succeeded.

The client needed a way to add events to the site, so I attached a headless CMS called Decap. All the client has to do is log in, add the event name, date, and URL, and click "Publish," and the event automatically renders on the Events page.

The site's most notable feature is a service worker that makes the site usable while offline. People often travel long distances to attend events Prairie Rose Arena, so I thought this might be handy. The service worker also makes the site very fast, since the browser doesn't have to fetch assets from the server.

**Skills:**

- Figma
- Eleventy
- Semantic HTML
- CSS3
- Netlify
- Decap
- Headless CMS

### Journalist - West Texan Media Group

While living in West Texas, I took several assignments from the *Big Bend Sentinel*, the region's preeminent newspaper. I'd done plenty of writing on my own time but had no prior experience as a journalist, so this was a learning experience more than anything.

I'm a self-conscious writer, so to counter that, I thought of my assignments like a game. The objective of the game was to convey as much personality as possible while conforming to the standards of the paper. Overall, I'd say the approach worked.

The other big challenge was talking to people. I'm a decent conversationalist, but approaching strangers for an interview felt different. My solution here was to try not be a journalist at all, but just a curious person who also happens to be writing down everything you say. I think it sort of worked, but my nerves might have shown more than I like to admit.

**Skills:**

- Journalism
- Writing
- Photography
- Interviewing
- Fact-checking

### Coffee Shop Manager - The Sentinel Marfa

I was initially hired as a barista, but it didn't take long for my responsibilities to expand beyond the job description. We were short-staffed, so I was on the lookout for opportunities to make my life easier (and everyone else's, too). Things like organizing the POS and creating new items for frequent or specialty orders.

After a few months, the owners had me take over ordering and inventory. Shortly after that, the manager moved to Houston and I took over scheduling and hiring. I wrote job postings, interviewed candidates, and trained new hires, all while working full-time front-of-house.

After about a year, the owner invited me to become a partner in the business. I turned him down because I had other ambitions and didn't think I could afford the time.

**Skills:**

- Employee interviewing
- Team management
- Employee training
- Inventory

### WordPress Developer/Online Store Manager - The Sentinel Marfa

The owners wanted an online store, and since I was the most tech-savvy person on the team, the job fell to me. I was given full responsibility for the project. The only stipulation was that I had to use WordPress and SiteGround.

I knew very little about coding and web development at the time, so this project involved a lot of research and tutorials. I learned how to set up a subdomain and point to it with DNS records. I learned how to use the WordPress block editor, and I picked up a little CSS here and there when I couldn't quite get the styles editor to do what I wanted.

I was also given license to design the storefront based on a provided color palette and logos. I took and edited product photos and added SEO descriptions. Once the store was live, I became the de facto manager. Customer service, inventory, and order-fulfillment all fell to me.

**Skills:**

- WordPress
- WooCommerce
- Search Engine Optimization
- Writing
- Customer Service
- Product Photography
