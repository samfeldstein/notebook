## Solved

### Change note type

As far as I can tell, there is no way to switch a card's type once it's created. This would be useful, as I sometimes forget to change a card's type when I make it.

When I eventually notice it, I have to duplicate the card, change the type, then delete the old card.

#### Solution

You go to browse, select the card, toggle notes, and right click, change the note type.

### During review, space bar makes app freeze

When I reveal an answer with space bar, sometimes the app freezes. I haven't been able to record this, because every time I've tried it's worked just fine.

I downloaded the [beta version](https://betas.ankiweb.net) of Anki, because that's what was suggested to someone having a [possibly related issue](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/bug-anki-freezes-when-using-spacebar-in-card-editor/44580). But it didn't work.

#### Solution

I tried [changing the video driver](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/anki-23-10-1-for-apple-silicon-freeze-during-review/36996) and that seems to have worked.
