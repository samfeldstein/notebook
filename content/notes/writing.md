1. Don't be boring.
2. Don't be confusing.
3. There is no preordained method. There are as many ways to write as there are writers. The best approach is the approach that works for you.
4. Write like you're trying to impress a girl.
5. Don't try to "be" interesting or "have" original ideas. That's impossible to do willfully. Instead, observe your thoughts and report back on the most interesting ones.
6. Writing is a means, not an end. We don't write just to write. We write to entertain, to explore, to teach, to learn, to confess, to profess, and most important, to find out what we think. Writing is incidental to expression.
7. Good writing is personable. It sounds like someone talking to you.
8. Good writing is clear.
9. Good writing is honest.
