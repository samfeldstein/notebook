**Doing things well is a skill,**, and therefore takes practice. So if you want to practice, it's good to believe that **if something is worth doing, it's worth doing well**.

**You can't do things well without paying [attention](notes/how-to-pay-attention.md).** Focus on one task at a time, whatever it is. It could be folding laundry. Think about what you're trying to achieve, observe what works and what doesn't, then course correct. Rinse and repeat.
