## Practice

- [Kase Scenarios](https://kasescenarios.com/) provides immersive, gamified OSINT challenges.
	- juries out on this one because some scenarios are unrealistic for example they ask you to find the unit number that a certain car is parked in front of as though it's happening in real time but the way you do it is through Google Earth, which is of course, a snapshot from the past.
	- It's also picky with its answers, which is annoying. For example, the answer to one of the questions is Southern Rockies Geocache, SRA-13, which is at Sustainable Resource Development in Calgary, but Kase only accepts the former answer.
