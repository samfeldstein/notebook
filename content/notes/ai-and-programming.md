A tool is a thing that makes it easier or possible to do something. We use GUIs instead of messing with the terminal. Granted, the terminal is more powerful. But it's also harder to use. The GUI makes it possible for a lot more people to do a lot more things with their computer. Isn't that a good thing?

The more user-friendly you make a tool, the more people use the tool. But the more user-friendly you make a tool, the harder it is (and the less relevant it becomes) to tell how the tool works. Use increases while understanding decreases.

One if we forced everyone to use the terminal that would presumably result in a lot more tech-savvy people, but then there's also the argument where well we wouldn't have invented beds if the ground was comfortable.

Maybe it comes down to whether you're in favor of lowering the barrier of entry to programming. Is the reaction from programmers to programming with AI different from the reaction of clergy to translating the Bible to English?
