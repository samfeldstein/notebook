Will LLMs make programming languages irrelevant? Paul Graham seems to think so:

> *Of course, I'm making a big assumption in even asking what programming languages will be like in a hundred years. Will we even be writing programs in a hundred years? Won't we just tell computers what we want them to do?*

Is the reaction from programmers to programming with AI different from the reaction of clergy to translating the Bible to English?

Fundamentally, how does programming with AI differ from programming in a language? You're still programming. The only difference is that you're doing one in English.
