How does programming with AI differ from programming in a language? You're still programming. The only difference is that you're doing one in English.

Isn't AI just a tool that simplifies the process? Are we against tools that simplify the process? We don't seem to be. We use them all the time. You don't even have to leave the programming realm to find examples. JavaScript is a (more) human-readable language that sits on top of 

When you write CSS, you aren't actually physically changing the layout. You're giving instructions to the computer, and the computer does it for you. How is this fundamentally different from telling Copilot to center the `nav` element. You gave the computer an instruction, and it wrote some code for you, which you give to your own computer, which interprets the code.

How does this change the role of the programmer? Programming with ChatGPT feels more like supervision or management. Writing code by hand feels more like working with your hands, which is probably why I and a lot of other people find it [[building-with-ai|more satisfying]] . But that aside, if you can do the same thing in half the time by just telling Copilot to do it, why wouldn't you?

A tool is a thing that makes it easier or possible to do something. We use GUIs instead of messing with the terminal. Granted, the terminal is more powerful. But it's also harder to use. The GUI makes it possible for a lot more people to do a lot more things with their computer. Isn't that a good thing?

The more user-friendly you make a tool, the more people use the tool. But the more user-friendly you make a tool, the harder it is (and the less relevant it becomes) to tell how the tool works. Use increases while understanding decreases.



One if we forced everyone to use the terminal that would presumably result in a lot more tech-savvy people, but then there's also the argument where well we wouldn't have invented beds if the ground was comfortable.

Maybe it comes down to whether you're in favor of lowering the barrier of entry to programming. Is the reaction from programmers to programming with AI different from the reaction of clergy to translating the Bible to English?
