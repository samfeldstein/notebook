## How to Write Effective Cards

"Why" over "what." Don't ask, "What lotion is best for burns?" Ask, "Why is aloe better for burns?" Both questions are simple, but the answer to the "what" question is implied in the "why" question. "Why" questions capture more information in just as many words.

**Draw the shortest line possible between question and answer.

## Ideas

An AI plugin to rewrite notes as rhymes or other mnemomic devices. [Anki Terminator](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1468920185) exists, which might be the closest thing. But in that case I'd rather open up GPT in the browser than mess with installing a plugin.
