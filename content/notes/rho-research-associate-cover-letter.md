To the Rho Recruiting Team:

I just submitted an application for the Research Associate Position, but I wanted to reach out and introduce myself, because frankly, nothing about my résumé suggests that I'd be interested in this position.

The ultra-short story there is: I used to want to be a screenwriter, I went to school for it, didn't like it, withdrew, moved to West Texas, managed a coffee shop, wrote for the local paper, moved out of West Texas, traveled around while freelancing as a web developer, wound up in Boulder, had an epiphany, rented a place here, began taking Psychology courses, walked to a coffee shop, ordered a coffee, sat down, found your job posting, wrote this email.

I'm currently taking Psychology courses at Yale through Coursera. I came to psychology by way of The Design of Everyday Things, Nudge, Thinking, Fast and Slow, and most recently, The Undoing Project. Assuming the course goes well, I plan to go back to school to study Psychology. In the meantime, I'm trying to find work as a research assistant.

Among the skills I'd bring to this role are writing, communications, website maintenance, and material organization. I honed my writing skills through my time as an English student, freelance journalist, and Hollywood development assistant. I've vastly improved my interpersonal skills over the years by working in various service and customer-facing jobs. I'm a confident and effective public speaker. I don't know if that's relevant to this role, but in a world where a substantial number of people are more afraid of public speaking than premature death, it seems worth mentioning.

I've managed websites and content for a number of businesses, including a coffee shop, local newspaper, art gallery, and equestrian event center. My technical skills include but are not limited to: Google Analytics, Google Sheets, SEO, and the core web languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I'm sure there's a lot I won't know coming in, but I'm tech-savvy and a quick learner.

I know my résumé doesn't look anything like the résumé of an ideal candidate, but I believe I have the skills and work ethic to excel as a Research Associate, if not the professional credentials. If there were any to do some kind of employment trial (no pun intended), I'd eagerly accept the opportunity.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to discussing the position further.

Sincerely,

Sam Feldstein
