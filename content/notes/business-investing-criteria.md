1. People want or need the product.
2. The product is unique.
3. The brand has a loyal following.
4. Debt is low compared to profit.
5. Resistant to extrinsic factors.

Bear in mind that people don't always care about brand. I don't know that most people really care which brand of eggs they buy. But cereal? Different story. Candy? Everybody's got a favorite.

So a test might be to ask if the bran is anybody's favorite.
