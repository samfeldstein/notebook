I think if I were teaching WCS, I would leave out the triple step at first. Just teach the six counts.

Next, break the six counts into three stages. Each stage comprises two beats. The stages are:

1. The leader steps out of the slot.
2. Something happens.
3. The leader steps back into the slot.

After you've laid that foundation, then bring in to the triple step. I think this order makes more sense, because the triple step is intimidating. It also distracts from the real thing, which is the back and forth, tension and release. I think it's more important to be thinking about that than whether you hit your triple step or not.
