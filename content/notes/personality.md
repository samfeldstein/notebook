I don't think personality traits matter so much as the force you bring to bear on them. For example, indulging an intrusive but pleasant childhood memory is as valid as suppressing the memory on the grounds that itâ€™s a waste of time.

You could imagine two intelligent people, let's even call them geniuses. One of them is a hopeless daydreamer (indulges the memory), the other is a disciplined scholar (suppresses the memory). Is one of these people obviously more admirable than the other?

So **maybe the capacity for genius is best measured by force of personality**, which itself is reflection of the person's ability to "commit to the bit," as it were.
