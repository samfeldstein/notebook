## Interests

**Edtech.** Tools that augment learning and productivity. Anki, Readwise, and Obsidian are good examples. As far as I can tell, most people don't even know that tools like these exist. In the scheme of things, I think I'd like to have a hand in making tools like these more visible and accessible.

**Storytelling.**

**Writing**, as a practice.

**Writing essays.**

**Pyschology**, espeically as it pertains to **behavioral economics**, **design**, and **story**.

I'm interested in **business** and **economics**, to some extent. I like making systems efficient and keeping books balanced, as it were.

**Investing.**

**Local-first software** and a **"more with less"** approach to technology.

**Effective Altruism.** Or effective anything, really.

**Photography.**

## Most Exciting

**How to learn effectively.**

**How to talk to people.**

**Love.**

**Dance.**

**Photography.**

**Web design.**

**Graphic design?**

## The kind of work I'd like to do

I want to be the guy who knows things. I don't want to be a scientist. But I want to know what the scientists are up to.

I'm a generalist by nature and practice. So perhaps consulting is in the cards. But to do that, you need a degree.
