## Interests

**Edtech.** Tools that augment learning and productivity. Anki, Readwise, and Obsidian are good examples. As far as I can tell, most people don't even know that tools like these exist. In the scheme of things, I think I'd like to have a hand in making tools like these more visible and accessible.

**Storytelling.**

**Writing**, as a practice.

**Writing essays.**

**Pyschology**, espeically as it pertains to **behavioral economics**, **design**, and **story**.

I'm interested in **business** and **economics**, to some extent. I like making systems efficient and keeping books balanced, as it were.

**Investing.**

**Local-first software** and a **"more with less"** approach to technology.

## Most Exciting

**Psychology, esp. behavioral.**

**Behavioral economics.**

**Nonfiction writing.** Thinking clearly is satisfying. Also gives you can excuse to be interested in whatever you want. I don't think I'm smart to enough to do great work in any given field, but maybe I'm smart enough to write about the great work other people are doing.
