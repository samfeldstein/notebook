## Interests

**Edtech.** Tools that augment learning and productivity. Anki, Readwise, and Obsidian are good examples. As far as I can tell, most people don't even know that tools like these exist. In the scheme of things, I think I'd like to have a hand in making tools like these more visible and accessible.

**Storytelling.**

**Writing**, as a practice.

**Writing essays.**

**Pyschology**, espeically as it pertains to **behavioral economics**, **design**, and **story**.

I'm interested in **business** and **economics**, to some extent. I like making systems efficient and keeping books balanced, as it were.

**Investing.**

**Local-first software** and a **"more with less"** approach to technology.

## Most Exciting

**Nonfiction writing.** Thinking clearly is satisfying. Also gives you can excuse to be interested in whatever you want. I don't think I'm smart to enough to do great work in any given field, but maybe I'm smart enough to write about the great work other people are doing.

**Behavioral economics.**

**Fiction**. Even after all this time, the idea of writing great dialogue gives me butterflies. And fiction gives you an excuse to be interested in whatever you want. In that sense, maybe fiction could be the black hole at the center of my galaxy.
