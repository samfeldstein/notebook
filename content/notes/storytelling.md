## Process

Stories are organic. They grow. Your job is to tend them. Paul Graham:

> In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants.
>
> The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal, but you can't discover natural selection that way.

> Watch what happens, write it down.

## Structure

Stories have macro-beats and micro-beats. Macro-beats are like a skeleton. They lend a story shape and structure. Micro-beats are everything that covers the skeleton: muscles, ligaments, blood. They are what make the skeleton interesting. As [Stephen Sondheim](https://bookshop.org/p/books/finishing-the-hat-collected-lyrics-1954-1981-with-attendant-comments-principles-heresies-grudges-whines-and-anecdotes-stephen-sondheim/6716906?ean=9780679439073) says, "God is in the details."

Think of music. Think of the first notes of the [*Lord of the Rings*](https://youtu.be/ehAgMszCHU4?si=Ycu5h4ksFoU4tBF0) theme. The skeleton of the measure is: D C D. (The notes could be wrong. I don't play music.) On its own, not unpleasant, but a little boring. Now add the staccato notes: D C DD C. Open GarageBand and try it. Instantly more interesting. The three notes on their own show potential, but don't have the sound of a finished thing. They are the bones. Adding the second D brings the piece to life.

So with story. Many short stories feel like summaries of longer stories because the author tried to cram a novel into ten pages. Only the bones would fit, and so the piece feels lifeless.

## Story tropes
