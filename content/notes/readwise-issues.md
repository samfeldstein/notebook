### Highlighted feed item padding

It'd be really nice if there were some padding between the currently highlighted item in a feed and the bottom of the screen. This would be especially helpful in the feed view, because once you get to the last item with the keyboard, it's partially blocked by the `Mark all as seen` button.

### Blue line position

I'd love it if the top of the blue line stayed in exactly the same place, typewriter-scroll style. That way when I jump paragraphs, my eyes know exactly where they need to go.

Also, when you push the up arrow, the browser switches to default behavior instead of the blue line moving, which throws everything off.

### Blue line handling of long paragraphs

Also, I like to keep the reader narrow and the font big. This means that paragraphs can be quite tall, which the blue line doesn't handle so well. If I reach the bottom of the page and the paragraph hasn't ended, the blue line jumps to the next paragraph, and sometimes scrolls past the rest of the unfinished paragraph in the process.

I'm not sure what the solution is here. But one possibility is an option to have the blue line go sentence by sentence, instead of paragraph by paragraph. Personally, I wouldn't mind that since I don't mind punching the down arrow that many times, and actually find it sort of engaging.

This might also allow for keyboard selection of text. If the blue line goes sentence by sentence, maybe there's an option to begin highlighting via traditional text-selection keyboard strokes, starting wherever the blue line is.

Hope that makes sense!

### Can't zoom desktop UI

You can't change the UI font size in the desktop app. There's a zoom option in the *Window* tab, but it does nothing.

### Other

I'd love to be able to justify text. Much easier to read for me.

it'd be nice if you could use the default font from your own browser or sytem.
