**To live a fulfilling life, you need a sense of purpose.** I think this is what people mean when they talk about "finding their place in the world" or "living a meaningful life."

What's a sense of purpose? I suppose this depends on the person, so all I can do here is answer for myself. **So for me, *purpose* is a sense that I've made a difference, that I've done something that matters.**

So when do/have I felt that way? Here's a list:

- When I helped my mom research a court case.
- When I help new dancers learn the basics.
- When I organized a writers' group in grad school.
- When I give feedback on friends' writing.
- When I taught horseback riding.
- When I built my website and notebook.

A lot of those examples involve working with people. And the goal of each collaboration seems to serve the other person. So maybe **I prefer helping to being helped.**

I'm not sure whether this would translate to collaborating in service to a mutual goal (eg, cofounding a company). I haven't done much of that. But I'm curious.

One of these (writers group) involves **community-building.** Haven't done much of that either. I do like hosting parties, though.

So the projects I've worked on that gave me the greatest sense of purpose involved **engaging collaborative work that also felt important**.

So maybe the formula is something like: *Engaging work + collaboration + importance = a sense of purpose.* Or:

***$E + C + I = P$***
