**To live a fulfilling life, you need a sense of purpose.** I think this is what people mean when they talk about "finding their place in the world" or "living a meaningful life."

What's a sense of purpose? I suppose this depends on the person, so all I can do here is answer for myself. **So for me, *purpose* is a sense that I've made a difference, that I've done something that matters.**

So when have I felt that way? Here's a list:

- When I helped my mom research a court case.
- When I've helped new dancers learn the basics.
- When I organized a writers' group in grad school.
- When I've given feedback on friends' writing.
- When I taught horseback riding.
- When I built my website and notebook.

## Is the Craft Enough?

I used to think I could derive purpose from craft, from making things. Now I think this is wrong. There are plenty of things I like doing and find satisfying. Taking photos, for instance. I like taking photos, and I'm proud of many of the photos I've taken. But could I spend all day taking photos and be satisfied? No. Because while I *like* photography, I don't feel that it matters much. It doesn't give me a sense of purpose. The best photographers in the world probably feel differently.

So for me, the craft itself doesn't lend a send of purpose. **The purpose comes from the application of the craft:** I'm not coding just to code. I'm coding to build something I can use. I'm not writing just to write. I'm writing to figure something out.

The said, the work itself matters too. I didn't enjoy helping my mom attach the snowplow to her truck nearly as much as helping her with the court case research. **So the work needs to be engaging.**

I guess what you're looking for is **maximum engagement + maximum importance**. But in lieu of that ideal situation, **the work either has to be engaging enough to make up for a lack of importance, or important enough to make up for a lack of engagement**. 

For example, writing fiction isn't important enough to me to make up how not-engaging it is. By contrast, coding is engaging, but when I do it for anyone other than myself or someone I care about, it doesn't feel important enough to be worth the effort.

## Helping People

Those examples above all seem to involve working with people. More specifically, **they all seem to involve collaboration.** Some of them involve some individual work (eg, researching a court case), but in service to a collaborative project. Teaching, when done right, is a kind of collaboration.

The goal of each collaboration seems to serve the other person. So maybe **I prefer helping to being helped.**

I'm not sure whether this would translate to collaborating in service to a mutual goal (eg, cofounding a company). I haven't done much of that. But I'm curious.

## Community-Building?

One of these (writers group) involves **community-building.** Haven't done much of that either. I do like hosting parties, though.

## The Formula

The projects I've worked on that have given me the greatest sense of purpose involved **engaging collaborative work that also felt important**.

So maybe the formula is something like: *Engaging work + collaboration + importance = a sense of purpose.* Or:

***$E + C + I = P$***

## Moving Forward

At the risk of being self-indulgent, it might be interesting to survey family and friends and see what they think you're good at.
