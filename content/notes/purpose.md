**To live a fulfilling life, you need a sense of purpose.**

What's a sense of purpose? I suppose this depends on the person, so all I can do here is answer for myself. **So for me, purpose is a sense that I've made a difference, that I've done something that matters.**

So when do/have I felt that way? Here's a list:

- When I helped my mom research a court case.
- When I help new dancers learn the basics.
- When I organized a writers' group in grad school.
- When I give feedback on friends' writing.
- When I taught horseback riding.
- When I built my website and notebook.

A lot of those examples involve **working with people**. And the goal of each collaboration seems to serve the other person. So it seems **I like helping.**

I'm not sure whether this translates to collaborating in service to a mutual goal (eg, cofounding a company). I haven't done much of that. But I'm curious.

One of these (writers group) involves **community-building.** Haven't done much of that either. I do like hosting parties, though.

As for the work itself: How engaging does it need to be? And here's another question: **For the times I've felt a sense of purpose, did I feel it because the work was engaging, or was the work engaging because I felt a sense of purpose?**

As usual, the answer is "both." The **work can't be boring and it can't be pointless.** If it's either of those things, the sense of purpose disappears. Also see: [Craft and Purpose](craft-and-purpose.md).

So it seems like **I feel the greatest sense of purpose when I'm doing engaging work with other people to help other people**.

So maybe the formula is something like: ***Engaging work + collaboration + helping = a sense of purpose.*** Or:

$$
E + C + H = P
