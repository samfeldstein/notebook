Hi [Host Name],

I'm traveling the States this year while I take courses in web development. I've done two Workaways now, one in Galveston, TX, one in New Orleans (where I am now). I've always wanted to travel more, but other things always seemed to take priority. Now that I'm between careers, it seems like a good time.

I read the description of your home and projects, and it sounds lovely. I've driven through Colorado but never spent time there. I'm excited to finally do so!

I'm most interested in the DIY/building aspect of the work, because I'd like to be a not-helpless homeowner some day. But really, I'm happy to assist with whatever you need.

I'm working very hard to build a webdev portfolio, so I spend a lot of time on that. But in my freetime I enjoy live music, hiking, biking, and photography.

I was looking to arrive somewhere around Sept. 10, and stay anywhere from a couple weeks to the full month. I can be flexible on arrival and departure dates.

Let me know what you think! I can also provide references from my former and current hosts if need be. Doesn't look like they've rated me yet.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Sam
