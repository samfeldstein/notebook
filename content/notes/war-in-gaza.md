[Matti Friedman](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/israel-insider-guide):  

> *When journalists cover the Jews’ war as more worthy of attention than any other, when they portray the Jews of Israel as the party obviously in the wrong, when they omit all possible justifications for the Jews’ actions and obscure the true face of their enemies, what they are saying to their readers—whether they intend to or not—is that Jews are the worst people on earth.*

This is how you retroactively justify the Shoah.

Sometimes I get the feeling that people care less about the crimes and more about the fact that Jews are committing them. And there's this sense that the Jews should know better.

I get the impression that people think Jews should be better than other people because they were nearly wiped out eighty years ago. And since they don't know better, so the thinking goes, then they must deserve everything they get.

## "It's not complicated"

If what people mean when they say it's not complicated is that killing innocent people under any circumstances is wrong no matter what, then they should be as ready to condemn Hamas as they are to condemn Israel. So what's the moral logic? What is the principle?

If the numbers are the concern, then as soon as Hamas is in a position to kill more Israeli children than Israel is to kill Palestinian children, Israel will take the moral high ground. The principle then becomes: "Whoever consistently kills more innocent people is the bad guy." Whoever has the upper hand physically is morally inferior.

Does that mean that whoever has the upper hand has the greater responsibility to show restraint? In general, I'd agree with that. But Israel does show restraint. People who think it doesn't you haven't considered what a lack of restraint would look like. Every Palestinian would have been killed long ago, wiped out by Israeli bombs. But they haven't been. They're there, and their population has exploded.

Let's assume Israel wants to kill all Palestinians. We don't have to assume they could. We know they could. So if they do want to kill all Palestinians, why haven't they?

Really, saying "it's not complicated" is just an excuse to not really engage with the hard questions. It's a way to avoid discomfort. But I'd argue that **if nothing about your narrative makes you uncomfortable, you aren't being honest about the issue.**

## Genocide charges

**Please do me the courtesy of assuming I’m stupid before you conclude that I support genocide.**
