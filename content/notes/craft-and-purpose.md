Can craft itself lend a sense of purpose? I used to think so. I used to think I could derive purpose from making things for the sake of it. Now I think this is wrong. There are plenty of things I like doing and find satisfying. Taking photos, for instance. I like taking photos, and I'm proud of many of the photos I've taken. But could I spend all day taking photos and be satisfied? No. Because while I *like* photography, I don't feel that it matters much. The best photographers in the world probably feel differently.

So for me, the craft itself doesn't lend a send of purpose. **The purpose comes from the application of the craft:** I'm not coding just to code. I'm coding to build something I can use. I'm not writing just to write. I'm writing to figure something out.

That said, the work itself matters too. I didn't enjoy helping my mom attach the snowplow to her truck nearly as much as helping her with court case research. **So the work needs to be engaging.**

I guess what you're looking for is **maximum engagement + maximum importance**. But in lieu of that ideal situation, **the work either has to be engaging enough to make up for a lack of importance, or important enough to make up for a lack of engagement**. 

For example, writing fiction isn't important enough to me to make up how not-engaging it is. By contrast, coding is engaging, but when I do it for anyone other than myself or someone I care about, it doesn't feel important enough to be worth the effort.
