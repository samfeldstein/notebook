Dear Ms. Parsons and the neuroAgility Staff:

I'm writing to apply for the Neurofeedback Technician Position posted on Indeed. I'm a freelance web developer and part-time Psychology student looking for full-time or part-time work in a research setting (clinical or otherwise).

My résumé doesn't exactly suggest that I'd be interested in this position, so I feel the need to provide some context. The ultra-short story version is: I used to want to be a screenwriter, I went to school for it, didn't like it, withdrew, moved to West Texas, managed a coffee shop, wrote for the local paper, moved out of West Texas, traveled around while freelancing as a web developer, wound up in Boulder, had an epiphany, rented a place here, began taking Psychology courses, walked to Rayback, ordered a coffee, sat down, found your job posting, wrote this email.

I'm currently taking Psychology courses at Yale through Coursera. I came to psychology by way of *The Design of Everyday Things*; *Nudge*; *Thinking, Fast and Slow*; and most recently *The Undoing Project.* Assuming the course goes well, I plan to go back to school to study Psychology.

Among the skills I'd bring to this role are writing, communications, interpersonal skills, and material organization. I honed my writing through my time as an English student, freelance journalist, and Hollywood Development Assistant. I've vastly improved my interpersonal skills over the years by working various customer-facing jobs.

I'm sure there's a lot I won't know coming in, but I'm tech-savvy and a quick learner.

I know my résumé doesn't look like the résumé of an ideal candidate, but I believe I have the skills and work ethic to excel as a Neurofeedback Technician, if not the professional credentials. Most of all, I'm an eager student. I'm just beginning my journey as a Psychology student, but I'm eager to absorb as much knowledge as I can.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to discussing the position further.

Sincerely,

Sam Feldstein
