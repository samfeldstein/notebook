## Criteria

I think what I'll do is start out as picky as possible, then pare this list down as my expectations are challenged.

- [ ] Has arthouse theater
- [ ] Country music scene
- [ ] Clean
- [ ] Good infrastructure
- [ ] No hurricanes
- [ ] At least 100,000 people

**Nice-to-haves:**

- [ ] Dry summer

- [ ] University
  - [ ] Low student/resident ratio

- [ ] Less than a million people

## Explanations

A couple quick reminders for myself, for those must-haves which are less self-evident.

**University.** College towns are more vibrant, and you're more likely (I assume) to meet smart people. Also, could audit courses.

**Less than a million people.** Only one point because presumably any city that size or bigger has surrounding neighborhoods and townships that might suit you.

**Job market.** Nice-to-have because your skills are suited to working with any small business or invidiual, and there will be plenty of those wherever you end up.
