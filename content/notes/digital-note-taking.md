I originally conceived of a blog page for my website, but much as I like reading blogs, blogging does not come naturally to me. Also, if you have a subject you want to interrogate, what's the point in writing a single essay about it? That assumes you'll draw a definitive conclusion. I think a better approach is the living document: a record of your thoughts on a subject, updated as those thoughts come to you.

The other thing I like about this idea is that it aims your thinking at the future. When you write about a subject, the question is, "What can I learn from this, and how can I best explain it to myself so I can use it in the future?"

This isn't my brilliant idea by the way. What I've just described is a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history?ref=ideasurg.pub). I just prefer to think of it as a notebook. I built mine with [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/).

## Second-order Relationships

If A is related to B, and B is related to C, then A has a second-order relationship to C. But Foam doesn't generate these relationships.

As [Kasey Klimes](https://www.kaseyklimes.com/notes/2019/10/16/an-augmented-mind-designing-a-personal-knowledge-base-with-notion) notes, second-order relationships are by definition less obvious than first order relationships. So second order relationships hold even more potential for surprising insights.

## The Future of Digital Notetaking

Digital notetaking is probably a primitive attempt to manually create neural networks in our brains. So the goal of all such technology (like [[anki|Anki]]), is to reduce the gap between the knowledge we put in the computer and the knowledge we put in our head. And I guess the perfect version of that system would be one that permits *Matrix*-style "uploading" of knowledge directly to the brain.
