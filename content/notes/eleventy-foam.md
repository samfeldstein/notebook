## Issues

### Relative links

**Relative links, as generated by Foam, don't work with 11ty's `_site/` output.**

Adding the `<base>` element to the `<head>` seemed to solve this. Example: `<base href="http://localhost:8080/">`.

Relative links in the source folder (eg `../recipes/cake.md`) don't account for the build output's pretty link structure, which looks like this: `_site/recipes/cake/index.html`. The relative link can't account for that extra `cake/` folder.

I don't fully understand why, but adding that `<base>` link seems to take care of it.

I haven't tested this on a live site yet.
