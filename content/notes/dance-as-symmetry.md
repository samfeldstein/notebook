When you dance with someone, **you become a system**. The aforementioned aliens should not immediately understand that they are looking at two distinct organisms.

Systems rely on symmetry. When two forces act on each other in equal proportion, you get symmetry. Think of a star and a planet. The planet orbits the star. If the star's gravity were too strong, it'd suck the planet into its core. If the planet were moving too fast, it'd fly off into space. Neither happens, because the relationship between the star's gravity and the planet's speed is symmetrical. It is balanced.

Likewise with dance. The leader is the star, because they remain more or less centered, while the follower "orbits" them. The follower is the planet, because they do all the spinning.

So I think what you have to do is attune yourself to your center of gravity, then attune your center of gravity to your partner's center of gravity. If you can do that, you get symmetry.

How do you attune yourself to your center of gravity? Well, first you have to find it. I'm guessing's everybody's center will be in a slightly different place. Mine hovers just below my solarplexis.

Once you find your center, you dance from it. It's tempting to dance from your feet, because that's how we walk; you move your foot first, then your body follows through. In dance, it's the other way around. Instead of moving your feet first, **you move your center first, and simply let your feet come with you.**
