> *Backlinks are implemented as an offline process which parses the Markdown sources for pages & the HTML for annotations, and extracts URLs+IDs. They could be implemented at compile-time, but it is not a good fit for a static site generator like Hakyll, so I simply run the backlinks as a cron job at night.*
