## Demons

### Bulgos the Terrorsmith

One of his arms is thick with muscle, like that of a blacksmith. The other is delicate and dexterous, like that of a tailor.

He considers himself a distinguished craftsman, and a passionate artisan.

### The Piece Demon

stitches itself together from various parts of people. tking the best features of each, such as the arm of a blacksmith or the brain of a scientist.

what does it start as?

### The Stench of Madgate Isle

Somewhere in the darkness beneath the world, where Madness picks its teeth with the bones of despair and Chaos walks on two legs, tortured souls wallow in the throes of endlessly reconstituted agony. It was here that Bulgos the Terrorsmith, in his workshop of wicked machinations, sewed the soul of Oz the Many-Faced into the animated stomach-lining of an ancient black dragon, thus creating the monstrosity known as the Stench.

***Amalgamation of horror.*** In its natural form, the Stench resembles a giant, pale-gray larvae dripping with stomach-acid and anguish. It walks on spindly legs, segmented and barbed like those of an insect. It’s arms, too, are insectoid, as are its fierce mandibles. Where its head should be is instead a sphincter from which the Stench spews the digestive fluids it uses to soften its victims, making them ripe for consumption. Where the chest would be on a humanoid, the writhing, ever-shifting form of Oz can be glimpsed beating against the walls of his flesh-prison.

***Sewn from the reams of insanity.*** The Stench lacks a stable consciousness of its own, instead seeking out beings of higher sentience and possessing them, sating its appetite and numbing the terrible agony of its true form. When it consumes a creature, the Stench cleaves itself directly to the soul of its host and wears its skin on the outside, leaving other creatures oblivious to the demon’s presence and allowing it easy access to its next victim.

***Demonic nature, demonic practice.*** The Stench’s brand of possession is particularly gruesome. Its mandibles clamp around a victim’s jaw, holding it in place while digestive enzymes spew from the demon’s sphincter, drenching the creature and breaking down its skin at a molecular level. Once the enzymes have done their work, the Stench slips through the cracks between the cells and latches to the victim’s soul.

Once a victim is possessed, its consciousness is woven so closely with the Stench’s that neither the possessor nor the possessed can distinguish itself from the other. The host remembers nothing of the demon, nor its horrifying ordeal, though afterward it suffers from grotesque nightmares and creeping paranoia, an effect which worsens the longer the possession lasts.

The Stench, in turn, loses its sense of self entirely, all but forgetting its own existence until the next time it is forced to feed, at which it will unwittingly emerge from its host, awaken to the reality of its own nature, and horrify itself further into insanity.

## Gods

### The First

AKA the Hand of Fate, The First has a complicated sense of self. It often speaks of itself in the third person, and in riddle-like fragments of sense. The following lines are known to none but those precious few who seek to understand The First.

> It was the First. It was borne, by what or whom it does not know. All it remembers is that at first it wasn’t, and then it was, and it has been ever since.

> The First will say, There is no such thing as Chance. All things that could be, are.

> The First will say, There is no Here or There. The nature of There is to not be Here, and so Here, There is unsensed. But There, There is Here, and Here is There.

> The First will say, a question is its own answer.

### Somnus, The God of Dreams

He spends his existence in a constant state of dreaming. within his subsconscious, dreammater drifts until it is lent structure by a dreamer, or an aspect of dream like the somnia.

He must be kept asleep, because existence is his dream. If he wakes, everything disappears.

## Mortals

### Bastion

A warforged paladin who has been standing guard on the same spot for 2000 years, per his orders.

Maybe the reason he’s standing in the same spot for so long is because somebody saw the future and told him to wait there for some specific reason. Like how in *Time Bandits* the devil tells the assassin to wait in the rock until Kevin’s house is built.

### EEEEEEE-BEHRT

As a young aberration, Mr. Palettecleanser made a name for himself while working as an assistant to renowned stage critic EEEEEEE-BEHRT, of the popular culture magazine, *Beholden*.

### Owl Capone

### Salxes Ignominy

Knight-Errant Sir Salxes Ignominy, once known as Sir Salxes Inconsequent, was a tiefling Knight of the Order of Chaos until his expulsion therefrom, after which he took Ignominy for his surname and devoted himself to his personal philosophy of Definitive Rectitude. It was the publication of his essay “The Proof of Definitive Rectitude” that Salxes was expelled from the Order.

Salxes first conceived of Definitive Rectitude whilst still a member of the Order of Chaos. His theory purports that moral uprightness is the inevitable outcome of any attempted contention with Impulse. Salxes stressed that the proper application of Definitive Rectitude was to the individual rather than society, as it was his personal belief that any individual who grappled with their own Vice could not help but reject it outright (assuming a true effort was made, i.e. that the individaul was not already given over to Impulse at the onset of said grappling), and a society comprised of such individuals would be an inevitably just one.

Salxes took a rational approach to his philosophy. In the same way that the definition of a word cannot include the word itself, he believed that one could not use morality as a justification for morality. In the essay that would lay the foundations of Definitive Rectitude as a school of thought, Salxes combined rationale with mathematical reasoning to form what he called The Proof of Definitive Rectitude, with which he incontrovertibly demonstrated the truth of his claim that morality was a natural and inevitable byproduct of a rational mind. Thus he formulated an argument for morality that was itself decidedly amoral.

But while Salxes illuminates morality as an essential facet of sentience, he is careful to emphasize that he does not intend to define morality. That is, he does nowhere in his works attempt to instruct the reader on how they should live. While he rejects relativism as a sophisticated excuse for nihilistic hedonism, Salxes admits that a permanent definition of morality is equally despicable. Rather, a code of ethics must change with its times and its adherents. Therefore, it falls to each generation of practioners to evolve from the previous, and to avoid at all costs falling victim to what he calls the “plush decadence of aquiescence.”
