## What is the part of our brain that can't distinguish fiction from reality?

This is the part of our brain that let's us enjoy stories. It's also the part of our brain that makes us believe in magic when we're younger. Is it also the part of our brain that makes people believe in God and astrology.

## Personality

You could say that about any personality trait. Don't ask if you *are* extraverted. Ask *when* you are extraverted.

## Know thyself

Don't ask if you are something. Ask *when* you are something. See [personality](#personality).

If you want to learn about yourself, *you have to try things.*
