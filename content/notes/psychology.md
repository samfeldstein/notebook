## What is the part of our brain that can't distinguish fiction from reality?

This is the part of our brain that let's us enjoy stories. It's also the part of our brain that makes us believe in magic when we're younger. Is it also the part of our brain that makes people believe in God and astrology.

This might be related to the [[psych|preoperational stage]] in children. Think of the t-rex in South Dakota. Adults know it's fake, but it scares the shit out of children.

## Know thyself

Don't ask if you are something. Ask *when* you are something. See [personality](#personality).

If you want to learn about yourself, [*you have to try things*](https://samfeldstein.xyz/blog/get-out-of-the-water/).
