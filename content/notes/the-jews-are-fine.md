I've been told more than once that "the Jews are fine." Never mind the fact that 30% of us were wiped out eighty years ago.

Also, by that rationale, **only minorities who *don't* thrive are considered minorities.** If the minority does well for itself, they cease to be a minority in the eyes of people who parse the world into these categories. They cease to be worthy of sympathy.
