Teachers are role models. They don't just teach you a skill. They teach you how to think. From Bob I learned to work smarter, not harder. From Ryan I learned that [[poetry-as-a-way-of-thinking|a car is a chair with four wheels]]. From Dirt I learned that jiujitsu is a conversation. So is dance, though I don't know who I learnedd that from.
