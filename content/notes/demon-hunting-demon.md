Character: A demon who hunts demons. Maybe he's half-demon, like a blade situation. Suits high fantasy? Or at least a more comic-booky world. Rancid Mayhem? Combine with those ideas. As the passages below imply, he's gone rogue. He saves souls instead of condemning them.

thinking not for the first time that his stomach wasn’t as strong as it used to be. Maybe it was this body rotting from the inside out, maybe it was something else: A functional clash, a manifest twisting of his nature spurred by every soul he saved, a knife twisting in flesh until it made a wound that could never heal. The Powers made a lot of noise about the consquences of denying one’s purpose, which they claimed were particularly woeful for demons of the Lower Circles. Demons like him.

For a long time he’d bought the line like everyone else. But the last few centuries he’d come to see it for what he believed it was: a lie. A yarn, like all the Diktats, spun to confuse the mind, to maintain the highest order of chaos, to kill dissent in the womb with the poison of doubt.

Now, with every creaking of his bones, every errant cough and unwarranted bowel movement, every pain in his stomach—signs of his host’s decay coming much sooner than they should have—he found himself wondering: Could he go on as he had been, operating in a manner so contrary to his nature without falling apart at the seams? It was a quandary. A crossroads of sorts. He took some grim joy from the irony.
