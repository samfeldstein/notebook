Societies often treat men as disposable. Even when cultures seem to prefer boys to girls, you have to consider how society is going to use those boys. When nations go to war, who gets sent to the front? Men are essentially treated as a renewable resource. A great many men in history were born to die, and continue to be.

This is also evident whenever a woman asks a man to kill a spider for her. The implication is that if the man gets hurt doing so, it wouldnâ€™t be as big a deal as if the woman did.
