## Counties

### Adams County

https://www.gosummer.com/post/colorado-short-term-rental-laws

> Adams County has not implemented any short term rental ordinances at the county level. **This means that vacation rentals are legal, unlimited, and unregulated.** They don't require a state STR license or permit, but they still need a business license to pay sales tax and lodging tax.

### ~~Boulder County~~

https://bouldercounty.gov/departments/community-planning-permitting/short-term-dwelling-vacation-rental-licensing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

> A Short-Term Rental is **the primary residence of an owner or tenant** and generally rented while the owner or tenant is residing and present at the property.

**So you can only rent it out if you also live in it.**

#### Resources

- [Property search](https://maps.boco.solutions/propertysearch/) - find out if a property is in the unincorporated country or in a city or town.

### Denver County

**Any short-term rental must be the host’s primary residence.**

### ~~Jefferson County~~

> Property must be minimum of 1 acre, meet the underlying zone district, have adequate parking, meet the requirements set for by the Wildfire Hazard Overlay District, have valid water and sanitation, have legal access, use the primary dwelling unit, be free of violations, and have no substantial detriment to the intent of the Zoning Resolution.

## Cities
### Altona

Appears unregulated. Jefferson County rules apply.

### Arvada

https://www.arvadaco.gov/259/Short-Term-Rentals

> A property owner or **a long term renter may operate a short term rental.**

Doesn't say if longterm renters have to live in the dwelling. Need to find the actual law.

> One owner may operate **up to three short term rental properties** within the City. However, **only one reservation is allowed per property at a time.**
