*In case anyone's reading this, I live in Boulder, CO at the moment, so some links might be Boulder-specific.*

## Time management

The majority of your time should be spent networking and building projects. Spend no more than 30 minutes a day applying for jobs.

## Prep

- ~~Write your resume~~
- ~~Update your Linkedin-profile~~
- Tell people you're looking for work
  - ~~People you know in the field~~
    <!--
    - ~~Dirt~~
    - ~~Josh Sacks~~
    - ~~Jillian~~
    - ~~Mike~~
    -->
  - Everybody else too, for good measure
    - Instagram 
  - Add your name to dev directories
    - [JSChimp](https://jschimp.com/)
- Build a network
  - [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/home/)
  - [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com)

- Think of questions for interviewers
