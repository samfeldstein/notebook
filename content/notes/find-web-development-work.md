## Professional Summary

### Career Goals

I'm looking for remote, full-time work in a boutique agency.

I specialize in development and design, creating refined, content-driven websites with a lean-web approach (vanilla code, static site generators, etc.).

I’m especially drawn to typography, layout, and content strategy. I love crafting bespoke, intuitive experiences.

I'd like to work with smaller, independent clients like small businesses, professionals, artists, writers, and niche publications.

Right now, I’m focused on executing great work, but I’m eager to grow into a leadership role as I build my skills and experience.

## Time management

The majority of your time should be spent networking and building projects. **Spend no more than 30 minutes a day applying for jobs.**

## Networking

> A network is a just a place you go to ask questions.
