## Obscurity

You make things easy by hiding underlying complexity. The simpler a tool, the harder it is (and the less relevant it becomes) to know how the tool works. **Use increases while understanding decreases**. This seems like it would be true most of the time, but I wonder how close the correlation is to -1.

## Texture

When things are too easy, they lose meaning. I think this is probably a sensory matter, and I think it's correlated with satisfaction. The better you can sense an action, the more satisfaction you get from taking it.[^1]

What's more satisfying? Driving an automatic or driving a stickshift? It's even reflected in the language. What's more fun to say? *Push the button* or *jam 'er down in gear*?

When you can't sense an activity, you lose your sense of particpation in the activity. When you lose your sense of particiatpion, you feel less and less like the driver and more and more like a passenger. *The* driver is someone important. *A* passenger could be anybody.

So **there's something missing from a frictionless life**. ("Yeah! *Friction*, stupid!"). Maybe this is why some people prefer a fraught relatinonship to no relationship at all.

That said, people obviously prefer automatics to stickshifts. So the allure of ease is powerful. Driving, for most people, is a necessary evil. The people who lament the demise of the stickshift are people already predisposed to find driving fun.

So maybe the difference is in whether you're a willing particpant in the activity. If you love driving, autonomous vehicles sound like the devil's handywork. If you don't like driving, they sound like heaven.

Likewise with coding. Writing code by hand is satisfying. Tell a  bot to do it for me isn't. Why? I think because when I write the code by hand, I feel like I've accomplished something. I feel like an agent. When the bot doesn't, that sense of accomplishment vanishes, even if whatever it wrote was my idea.

So maybe it behooves programmers to try to derive satisfaction from the outcome instead of the process. Or rather, from higher-level problem solving instead of low-level.

## Waste

When things are easy to use, we use them more, and may consume more resources in the process. I wonder if households used a lot less water before washing machines were invented.

This is especially bad if the additional consumed resources include our own time. I read somewhere that when the washing machine was invented, housewives actually spent *more* time doing laundry, because they *could* do so much more.

So what's the lesson there? Be suspicious of products that are supposed to make your life easier. Or at least pay attention to whether they actually do.

[^1]: I originally said "fun" instead of "satisfaction", but decided fun was too narrow. For instance, it doesn't really apply to the bad relationship scenario, but satisfaction does, especially of the perverse variety.
