## Obscurity

You make things easy by hiding underlying complexity. The simpler a tool, the harder it is (and the less relevant it becomes) to know how the tool works. **Use increases while understanding decreases**. This seems like it would be true most of the time, but I wonder how close the correlation is to -1.

## Texture

When things are too easy, they tend to lose meaning. You lose your sense of participation. And that might just be beacuse we can't actually sense them. We have the sense that nothuing in particular is going on. If we can't sense it, it might as well be there. Myabe this is why it sometimes feelsl ike people would prefer to have a fraught relatinonship than no relationship at all? At least with the fraught relationship you feel something.

Not to be too materialist, but I think this is probably a sensory matter.

Think of people who lament the decline of the stickshift. **There's something missing from a frictionless life**. ("Yeah! *Friction*, stupid!)

## Waste

When things are easy to use, we use them more, and may consume more resources in the process. I wonder if households used a lot less water before washing machines were invented.

This is especially bad if the additional consumed resources include our own time. I read somewhere that when the washing machine was invented, housewives actually spent *more* time doing laundry, because they *could* do so much more.

So what's the lesson there? Be suspicious of products that are supposed to make your life easier. Or at least pay attention to whether they actually do.
