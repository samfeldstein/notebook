[Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f1n):

> Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.

Graham again:

> Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for.
> 
> And that is what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good.

There's a category of smart person that I particularly admire: guys who beat the system. Guys who see what no one else sees and that gives them an edge. Read *The Big Short* (or any of Michael Lewis's books, really), and you'll know who I'm talking about.

I don't know that you can intentionally become like these people; so much depends on circumstance. But you can probably train yourself to look for the things that nobody else sees. The most obvious way to do that seems to be: **notice where everyone else is looking, then look in the opposite direction**.
