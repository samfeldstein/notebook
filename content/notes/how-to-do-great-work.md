[Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f1n):

> Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.

Graham again:

> Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for.
> 
> And that is what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good.
