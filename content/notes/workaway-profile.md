## Description

Hi, I'm Sam. I'm a beginner traveler looking to explore, learn, make friends, and return with stories to tell.

I grew up on a small farm in Iowa. As a kid, I spent a lot of time working in my mom's garden and riding horses.

I'm currently taking web development classes online. When I'm not doing that, you'll probably find me biking, exploring the city, catching a show, catching a movie, writing, reading, or taking photos.

I plan to stay in the States for the rest of this year, but at some point I'd love to go to Europe.

Traveling more has been a goal of mine for a long time, and I can't wait to get started!

## Skills

I grew up on a farm, so I've spent a lot of time working outside. I've mended fence, pulled weeds, chopped firewood, driven a tractor, shoveled manure, etc.

I rode horses for about thirteen years, starting when I was five or six.

I'm a decent hand in the kitchen.

I've held a lot of jobs over the years. In college I worked at a library and taught horseback riding. Since then, I've been a freelance journalist, content writer, freelance web developer, teacher's assistant (grad school), script reader for a Hollywood production company, bartender, and bar/coffee shop manager, among other things.

When I lived in Southern California I volunteered for an independent movie theater called the Frida, and absolutely loved it.

I'm pretty good with computers, and I'd be happy to help with anything computer- or internet-related.

I went to school for English and writing, and I'm happy to teach writing or reading skills.

I'm an intermediate photographer, so I can teach the basics but would love to learn more! Especially about color correction and editing.

## What else...

If there's anything you'd like to know about me that I haven't mentioned, just ask!
