- [ ] Scrape each page for outgoing links and render them under Further Reading
- [ ] Sitemap
- [ ] Projects page
- [ ] Gallery
- [ ] [[posse|POSSE]]

## Styles

- Add small caps to first line of posts.

## Performance

- [x] Preload assets
- [x] Cloudflare caching
- [ ] Add service worker

### Cloudflare caching

I set it to cache assets for a year, so font files are now being served from the user agent's cache every visit. Seemed to make the site much faster.

## Wishlist

- Search
- Guestbook
- Text size buttons: `+` or `-`
